|       |---> Yes: Does it consist of raw ingredients?  
|       |       |  
|       |       |---> Yes: Who will prepare it?  
|       |       |       |  
|       |       |       |---> Me (pre-prep needed for easy assembly/reheat)  
|       |       |       |       |  
|       |       |       |       |---> Can I reliably prep in advance?

|       |       |       |       |       |---> Yes: Meals are prepped for easy assembly (e.g., meat + carb + sauce) ✅  
|       |       |       |       |       |  
|       |       |       |       |       |---> No: Unviable solution ❌

|       |       |       |       |       |---> Yes: Meals can be based on simple prep (e.g., pasta + protein) ✅  
|       |       |       |       |       |  
|       |       |       |       |       |---> No: More complexity = More friction = Unviable solution ❌  
|       |       |  
|       |       |---> No: Pre-packaged/easy food = Expensive (close to fast food cost) ❌  
|  
|---> No: Is it pre-packaged or a meal kit?

|  
|---> No: Fast food = Expensive (fallback option but not ideal) ❌
