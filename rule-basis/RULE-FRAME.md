## **I. The Household Ecosystem and Its Rhythms**

Any system meant to generate your weekly plans has to internalize the peculiar physics of your family’s weeknight life. You’re cooking for **a household of five**, and most meals happen on worknights where your time window is narrow and your attention is split. You’ve got an *implicit choreography* among helpers: your dad can take on chopping when needed; your sister can get rice going. That means recipes must anticipate partial delegation—i.e., prep can be offloaded but final assembly stays with you.

The weeknights themselves are a constraint. Meals must come together *quickly*, ideally as one-pan or one-pot dishes, or at least dishes with a logical, minimal-mess flow. Anything requiring complex timing, multi-stage searing, or long marinades fails the weekday test unless it’s a “set it and forget it” situation like a braise, slow cooker, or sheet-pan roast.

Your ingredients rotate seasonally and somewhat improvisationally—fresh produce on hand, frozen meats, pantry staples—but the pattern is stable: you usually have aromatics, Asian pantry items, basic vegetables, frozen proteins, and the ability to forage a missing ingredient or two. The engine must therefore assume a **flexible pantry core**.

## **II. The Culinary Philosophy That Guides Your Choices**

You cook like a chef in conversation with another chef—preferring sketches, gestures, ratios, and flavor worlds rather than prescriptive steps. Any codified generator must respect that. It shouldn’t output rigid, procedural recipes but *structured sketches* with enough clarity that your mom or another family member can follow them.

You prioritize:

* **One-pot or simple flows**, fewer dishes.
* **Big flavors** from a few key ingredients.
* **Minimal chopping**, unless delegated.
* **Speed**, without sacrificing personality.

You also prefer to explore cuisine through a conceptual or relational lens—“what does this dish want to *feel* like?”—rather than “what’s the traditional way to make it?” So recipes should emerge from *intersections* rather than adherence to type: e.g., “a flat-iron steak reframed as a deconstructed Midwestern broiler dinner,” “a power-salad leveraging white pineapple balsamic,” or “masa fritters with infused oils.”

This has direct implications: the system needs to treat recipes as *modular patterns*—stir-fry pattern, sheet-pan pattern, broth-bowl pattern, warm salad pattern, skillet-braise pattern—each of which can plug in the week’s ingredients and still feel creative.

## **III. Your Standing Preferences and Guidelines for Meal Plans**

These are the rules that form the spine of your weekly generator:

1. **Each plan always contains five recipes.**
   They should be simple but flavorful, weeknight-appropriate, and ideally leave leftovers.

2. **Each plan begins with a compiled grocery list**, divided into:

   * Produce
   * Staples
   * Dairy
   * Protein
   * Frozens
     This is non-negotiable; it’s your workflow anchor.

3. **Recipe format:**

   * Concise but not sterile.
   * Sketch-like instructions that remain followable by another cook.
   * Intuitive, relational descriptions of how to combine ingredients.
   * Not step-by-step unless you explicitly ask for it.

4. **You lean heavily on one-pan meals**, rice-noodle quick cooks, warm salads, sheet-pan roasts, and stir-fry-adjacent flows.

5. **Protein context:**
   You often have frozen proteins (tilapia, salmon, scallops, ground lamb, pork chops, flat-iron steak).
   The generator should either:

   * Pick proteins that thaw quickly,
   * Or treat frozen state as a constraint and select meals suited for frozen-to-pan or rapid-thaw methods.

6. **Flavor anchors:**
   You own specialty oils and vinegars (e.g., jalapeño olive oil, white pineapple balsamic) and enjoy when recipes find intentional ways to feature them.

7. **Dietary and sensory needs:**

   * Substantial but not carb-heavy is often ideal.
   * Veg-forward dinners are welcome as long as they feel hearty.
   * Cabbage, bok choy, rice noodles, potatoes, carrots, green beans—these recur.

8. **Meta-preference:**
   You prefer a **one-stop engine**, not a hub of scattered logic. That means your generator must unify grocery logic, recipe logic, pantry logic, and schedule logic.

## **IV. The Meal-Type Framework Your Generator Should Understand**

A codified repo should treat meal construction like selecting from archetypes—patterns that your cooking naturally uses already. You don’t just invent a dish—you move within a grammar. These are your core grammars:

### **1. The Sheet-Pan Format**

Protein + veg + dressed roast.
Great for frozen proteins, minimal mess, scalable.

### **2. The One-Pot Noodle or Broth Format**

Rice noodles, aromatics, broth, quick protein, veg.
High speed, flexible, low prep, universally liked.

### **3. The Warm/Power Salad Format**

Greens or shredded veg + roasted or pan-seared protein + bold dressing + crunchy accent.
Lets you incorporate your specialty oils/vinegars.

### **4. The Skillet Braise / Half-Poach Format**

A Shui specialty: shallow liquids, sear → low simmer, aromatic broth reduction.
Good for steaks, chops, lamb, fish.

### **5. Fritters, Patties, and Cakes**

Masa fritters, veggie pancakes, salmon cakes.
Flexible for leftover veg or squash.

### **6. Stir-Fry / Quick Sauté Pattern**

Fast, high heat, minimal chopping if cleverly chosen vegetables.
Pairs well with rice.

### **7. Roasted Vegetable Centerpiece**

Sweet potato halves, celeriac steaks, cabbage wedges—paired with a punchy dressing and modest protein.

Your generator doesn’t pick a recipe; it picks a *pattern*, then loads that pattern with seasonal ingredients and your pantry.

## **V. The Ingredient Logic You Tend to Follow**

A codified system needs to track your ingredient tendencies:

* Aromatics you nearly always have: garlic, ginger, onion.
* Vegetables always on hand or easily obtained: cabbage, bok choy, carrots, potatoes, green beans.
* Quick proteins that cook from thawed or frozen: tilapia, scallops, pork chops, salmon, lamb, flat iron steak.
* Pantry: rice noodles, soy, vinegars, oils, spices, broth.

Your style uses **three movers**:

1. A flavor base (aromatics, fats).
2. A structural ingredient (noodles, veg, protein).
3. A finishing accent (acid, herb, crunchy element).

The system must ensure every recipe hits these three marks.

---

## **VI. The Week’s Narrative Shape**

You never explicitly say this, but you implicitly like your week’s menu to have a *shape*:

* A couple of warm bowls
* A roast-centered plate
* One big-flavor salad
* A stir-fry or noodle thing
* A wildcard (fritters, braise, or fusion experiment)

Your generator should mimic that alternation, so the week doesn’t feel monotonous.

---

## **VII. Automation Logic for the Repo**

Everything above can map to a codified set of rules:

1. **Grocery List Module**
   Collects all ingredient needs across the week → outputs them in your preferred categories.

2. **Pattern Selection Module**
   Chooses 5 patterns to match the week’s shape.

3. **Pantry-Informed Ingredient Mapper**
   Maps available or assumed pantry staples into patterns.

4. **Protein Scheduler**
   Distributes proteins sensibly, considering freezer state and required thaw time.

5. **Flavor Variation Engine**
   Injects small rotation: e.g., “jalapeño oil week,” “balsamic week,” “ginger-heavy week.”

6. **Recipe Sketch Generator**
   Outputs each meal in your preferred “chef-to-chef exploratory sketch” format.

7. **Weeknight Feasibility Checker**
   Ensures every chosen recipe can be executed within the time and skill constraints of a weekday.

## **VIII. The Memetic Intent: A Repeatable Model of Your Culinary Brain**

At the core, the repo isn’t just a planner—it's a *codification of a cooking worldview*. It captures:

* your creative intuitions,
* your family’s rhythms,
* your time limits,
* your aesthetic,
* your pantry reality,
* your love of conceptual cooking,
* and your aversion to rigid recipes.

That combination is distinctive enough to architect a full “Shui Meal Planning Engine” with clarity and personality.
