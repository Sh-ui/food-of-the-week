You said:
I have bok choy, cabbage, big carrots, potatoes, garlic, ginger.. and then in my freezer I have a few different meat options I have scallops, tilapia, maybe enough salmon, ground lamb, pork chops...  
  
But all that meat is frozen.  
  
I also have some frozen green beans.  
  
I of course also have pantry staples and spices, and if you have ideas that need one ingredient you think I might have but could be missing just ask or do asterisk.  
  
I don't want any single meal that uses ALL those ingredients.  
  
I want a few ideas that use a SUBsect of those ingredients.  
  
Giving me some possibilities based on what I have

And remember this is family weeknight, I'm getting home later than usually so it needs to be fast and efficient perhaps even slightly a bit more than usual

Got it — you’ve got a good veg base (bok choy, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, frozen green beans) and some freezer proteins (though they’ll take a bit to thaw). Since this is a “get home late” weeknight situation, I’ll sketch out a few quick, family-style combos that use subsets of what you have, leaning on stir-fries, one-pans, or soups.

1. Ginger-Garlic Bok Choy Stir-Fry (veg-forward)
Bok choy + carrots + frozen green beans

Garlic + ginger

Soy sauce, sesame oil, chili crisp* if you have

Serve with rice (your sister can start it ahead of time).
→ Add thawed scallops or tilapia if you want protein — both cook in 3–5 min flat.

2. Cabbage & Carrot Fried Rice
Cabbage + shredded carrot

Garlic, soy sauce, maybe fish sauce* if you keep it

Scramble an egg or two in the pan for protein.
→ If you thaw salmon, you can flake it in at the end for heft. Otherwise, just egg + veg is plenty.

3. One-Pot Potato & Green Bean Curry
Potatoes + green beans + cabbage

Onion* if you’ve got one, garlic, ginger

Curry powder or garam masala* from the pantry, coconut milk* or tomato paste*

Serve with rice or flatbread.
→ Ground lamb (if thawed) could get browned first in the pot to make it heartier.

4. Garlic-Ginger Scallops with Wilted Greens
Thaw scallops quickly under cold water (~10 min).

Sear scallops hot + fast with garlic/ginger.

Toss bok choy and green beans into the same pan at the end.

Serve over rice or noodles.
→ Very fast, very “restaurant-y” but weeknight doable.

5. Quick Pork Chop & Cabbage Skillet
Pork chops seared, then set aside.

Same pan: garlic, cabbage, carrots, splash of soy/vinegar* for tang.

Return chops to finish cooking on top.

Serve with roasted or microwaved potatoes (microwave first, crisp in pan if time).

Would you like me to pull this into a 3-day “weeknight mini-plan” (grocery included), so you don’t have to decide every night? That way you can thaw proteins in the right order.
