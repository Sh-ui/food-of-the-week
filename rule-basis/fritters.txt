I want to serve grilled shrimp with some dressed roughage. Red cabbage, fire-roasted corn, grilled pineapple, poblano pepper, and then I have some toasted jalapeno olive oil and some white pineapple balsamic. I want to serve that grilled shrimp and dressed roughage with, I think, maybe some fritters. Maybe, do you think that would fit in my family weeknight-style plan if I do them as, like, oven fritters, maybe? Using an ice cream scoop to create little dollops and then putting them on an oiled sheet pan and putting them under high heat in the oven and putting enough oil in the fritter batter that they get some good brownage. But I don't want – I have some amazing masa, hacienda masa, masa harina of different colors. I have red and blue and yellow and white, so I could make the fritters any color. But I want to put stuff in them to have them be really, truly, deeply flavorful and still balanced, not just be lumps of starch. And then maybe I need some kind of creamy dressing I can pour over that whole meal to bring it all together.

You’re circling a pretty interesting triad here: grilled shrimp with high-toned acidity/sugar/smoke; a roughage base that’s leaning crunchy, sweet, vegetal; and then these oven-fritters that need to belong without dragging the whole plate toward heaviness. The challenge, if I’m reading your instincts right, is that you want the fritters to play as a third voice—not ballast, not dessert, not cornbread-in-disguise—so you need to weave aroma and savor through the masa itself in a way that resonates with the bright pineapple–poblano–corn–jalapeño world you’re building elsewhere.

Start thinking of your fritter batter less like “masa + mix-ins” and more like “masa carrying an aromatic broth.” Hydration is your lever. If you bloom a little garlic, scallion, or shallot in your toasted jalapeño oil—just enough warmth to coax the aromas up—and then fold that oil and its fond into the batter, you’re already halfway to flavor density. If you want them to land squarely in the same register as the grilled roughage, you could steep the hydration liquid with roasted poblano scraps, grilled-corn cobs, maybe even a splash of that pineapple balsamic for acidity. The masa drinks in aroma surprisingly well.

Think, too, about texture contrast within the fritter. A little grated zucchini or carrot (squeezed dry) plays the role of internal steam generator, keeping them tender inside while letting the outside go crisp. Fire-roasted corn kernels would bring sweetness, but a few chopped herbs—epazote if you have it, cilantro if you don’t—mean the fritters don’t just collapse into “yellow.” Even slivers of green onion or very small dice of raw white onion give an internal pop against the softer masa. And your colored masas let you lean into visual contrast: blue masa with bright corn and green onion looks almost celebratory next to grilled shrimp.

As for the oven-fritter method, yes—100% weeknightable. High heat, well-oiled sheet pan, lightly oily batter, and the ice-cream-scoop dollop method will give you that pseudo-fried edge. Let the bottoms sit undisturbed long enough to deepen into that brick-red-but-not-burned gold; flip or don’t, depending on how crispy you want the tops.

The whole plate still wants a unifying cool element, which is where your “creamy dressing” instinct is dead on. Think of a crema that isn’t trying to be ranch or aioli but is instead acting as a mild emulsifier between sweet, smoky, charred, and acidic. Greek yogurt or sour cream loosened with lime and a whisper of pineapple balsamic becomes a bridge. Fold in a spoonful of minced cilantro stems for that subtle vegetal crunch, or a tiny bit of grated garlic if you want it punchier. The trick is to keep it thin enough to drizzle rather than dollop. You want the dressing to seep into the cabbage, gloss the shrimp, and gently kiss the fritters without smothering their crispness.

If you want to get slightly more mischievous in flavor, add a little grilled-pineapple juice to the dressing for a caramelized tang—but only a few drops, or it gets cloying. The toasted jalapeño oil could sit on top of the crema as a final glossy ribbon. The whole plate becomes this warm, cool, crunchy, tender conversation where the crema is the translator and the fritters are the grounding bass note.

And yes—this is absolutely weeknight-capable if you set up your components so the roughage is raw/assembled ahead, the shrimp hit the grill last minute, and the fritter batter is just a quick stir-and-scoop before the oven. The only real question is how boldly you want the fritters to speak. Would you rather they echo the pineapple–corn sweetness, or push the other direction—more savory, herbaceous, a little charred poblano edge to counterbalance the fruit?

So I'm thinking for the fritters, I'm doing the yellow masa harina, some diced, finely diced white onion, and then some thinly sliced, maybe like julienned yellow squash that I've salted and then drained. And definitely making use of the oil and balsamic in the mix for that. And a good amount of white pepper. What kind of ratios would I be looking at for those? And then they probably would need like baking powder in them or something as a leavening agent, right? Or maybe I could get away with baking soda if I'm putting some acidic ingredients in there. Maybe I could even put some Greek yogurt in the fritters and then use that to make my crema.

Let me push you a little here, because the thing you’re sketching wants to stay on the edge between “masa fritter” and “savory masa pancake,” and the ratios are where that identity either holds together or falls apart. The real question isn’t how much squash or onion—it’s how much structural water you’re willing to let into the masa before it loses its ability to crisp and starts acting like a steamed dumpling. The salt-and-drain move is exactly the right instinct, but the masa will still try to drink more moisture than you expect, especially when fat and acid are also entering the picture.

If you want a starting point that keeps ballast low and flavor high—something that crisps on the bottom in the oven while staying tender inside—think of it in rough proportions like a cornbread batter, not a dough. A cup of masa harina wants roughly a cup of total hydration to behave pancake-style, but your squash is bringing its own contribution, your aromatics are bringing none, and your fat and acid will change the way bubbles form and brown. So treat 1 cup masa as your anchor, then let everything else be dialed around it.

You’re probably imagining something like:

— Enough squash to be visible and texturally present, but not enough to steam the fritters from within.
— Enough onion to perfume the mix, not so much that you’re biting into an onion patty.
— Enough yogurt to wake up a little baking soda without turning the batter into cake.

If you’re going the yogurt route—and it’s actually a smart call, because it gives you acid for lift and fat for browning—then baking soda alone is risky. The masa doesn’t have built-in acidity, and you don’t want to rely entirely on the yogurt for activation. A small hybrid leavening is safer: a bit of baking powder for guaranteed neutral lift, plus a pinch of baking soda to respond to the acid. This keeps the oven fritter light without ballooning or tasting soapy.

The yogurt also gives you a bridge to the crema, if you portion some out early.

So imagine a fritter batter that behaves almost like a corny hushpuppy, but spreads slightly on the pan and crisps around the edges:

For each cup of masa harina, you’re circling something like:

• 1 cup total liquid, divided between:
– ½ cup water or broth (this is your adjuster)
– ¼ cup Greek yogurt (your acid and fat)
– 2–3 tablespoons of your toasted jalapeño oil + white pineapple balsamic combined
– plus the moisture trapped in your squash

• ⅔ cup salted, drained julienned squash (think of a loose handful—enough to stud the mix, not enough to dominate)

• ¼ cup finely diced white onion, or less if you want onion as an accent rather than a feature

• ½ teaspoon baking powder + a pinch (⅛ tsp) baking soda

• White pepper to taste, but don’t be shy—masa loves it

The thing you must keep reactive in your mind is the hydration: you add the water last, dribbling it in until the batter sits in that sweet point between “stiff pancake batter” and “loose drop biscuit.” If you can scoop it with an ice cream scoop and it mounds softly but doesn’t slump into a puddle, that’s your signal.

And yes, this all stays well within your weeknight constraints because none of this is fiddly. The oven does the frying for you, the batter is one bowl, and you’re not trying to beat air into anything delicate. You’re just building a batter that carries onion sweetness, squash tenderness, the aroma of your jalapeño oil, and the acidity of your pineapple balsamic without turning soggy or dense.

Once you land the hydration and the leavening, the fritters will crisp, the shrimp will pop, the roughage will stay bright, and the crema will bind the whole plate together. What’s your instinct leaning toward—more savory depth in the fritters or more brightness to echo the pineapple–corn side?
