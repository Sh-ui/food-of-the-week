## Italian Lazy Meatballs

##### SousVidePrep+

#### Protein:
Sweet Italian sausage + ground beef

#### Ingredients:
Sweet Italian sausage, ground beef, panko, fresh parsley, garlic, parmesan, egg, mozzarella, italian bagged salad, shredded carrots, shallot, olives, yukon gold potatoes, italian dressing, italian herbs, milk

#### Description:
Italian-American meatballs halfway between meatloaf and meatballs - the kind that get baked large and topped with gooey melted mozzarella. Served with Italian salad and garlicky Tuscan mash.

### Already Prepped
- Meatballs are formed and chilling in the fridge.
- Potatoes are already chopped and vacuum sealed in bags. Stored in fridge.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At **3:30pm**, drop the already-chopped potatoes into the **sous vide bath** (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app).

Make the Italian salad by combining the italian bag mix with olives, shredded carrots, and one finely diced shallot. Leave undressed. Store in fridge until serving.

At 5:00pm on the lower rack, put meatballs in oven at 400°F. Insert predictive probe at an angle into center meatball, **set temp to 157°F**.

When meatballs hit temp, pull them out of the oven and let them rest on the stovetop, but **do not** remove the probe.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

For the mash: use the already-cooked potatoes, pressed garlic, chopped parsley, chopped basil, dired oregano, heavy cream, and parmesan. Season with salt and white pepper.

Make the dressing by combining the dressing packet according to its instructions, using olive oil, vinegar, and water.

Shred some mozzarella off a block to cover the meatballs. Put them back under the broiler to warm them back up and finish the cheese.

Serve meatballs with melted cheese on top, garlicky Tuscan mash on the side, and Italian salad.
