## Meal 1: ~~Stir Fry~~

**Protein:** Sirloin flap steak

**Ingredients:** Purple asparagus, bok choy microgreens, shallot, brown rice (at home)

**Description:** Quick stir fry with tender sirloin flap steak, purple asparagus, and aromatic shallot, finished with delicate bok choy microgreens. Served over brown rice.

**Instructions:**

**Already Prepped:**

 - Sirloin flap steak is thawed.

**Sous Chef - Prep:**

Start the brown rice cooking according to package directions (or use a rice cooker).

Slice the sirloin flap steak thinly against the grain. Season with salt and pepper. You can marinate briefly in soy sauce, a touch of cornstarch, and sesame oil if you have 10 minutes.

Trim the woody ends off the asparagus and cut into 2-inch pieces. Slice the shallot thinly.

**Chef - Finishing & Plating:**

Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add oil with a high smoke point (vegetable, grapeseed, or peanut oil).

Stir fry the beef in batches to avoid crowding—you want a good sear. Set aside on a plate.

In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir fry the shallot for 30 seconds until fragrant, then add the asparagus. Cook for 2-3 minutes, tossing frequently, until bright and tender-crisp.

Return the beef to the pan. Add a quick sauce: soy sauce, a splash of rice vinegar or rice wine, maybe a touch of honey or sugar, and garlic/ginger if you have them. Toss everything together for about 30 seconds.

Plate over the brown rice. Top with a generous handful of the bok choy microgreens—they'll wilt slightly from the heat and add a fresh, peppery finish.


## Meal 2: One Pot Pasta

**Protein:** Ground pork

**Ingredients:** Brown udon rice noodles, tomato paste, San Marzano tomatoes, frozen mixed mushrooms, frozen three pepper blend

**Description:** A hearty one-pot pasta that combines ground pork with rich tomato sauce, mushrooms, and peppers. Quick weeknight meal with minimal cleanup.

**Instructions:**

**Already Prepped:**

 - Ground pork is thawed.

**Sous Chef - Cooking:**

Brown the ground pork in a large pot or deep skillet with a drizzle of oil. Break it up as it cooks. Once browned, add chopped garlic and onion + rimalicious seasoning. Stir in the tomato paste and let it caramelize for a minute or two.

Add the San Marzano tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or a wooden spoon as you add them. Fill one of the empty cans halfway with water and add that too. Bring to a simmer.

Add the frozen mushrooms and frozen pepper mix directly from the freezer. Add umami boosters to taste; like soy sauce, fish sauce, msg, a pinch of sugar. Let everything simmer for 10-15 minutes to meld the flavors.

Add the udon noodles directly to the pot. Cook according to package directions, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender and have absorbed some of the sauce. If it gets too thick, add a splash of water.

Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Finish with fresh herbs if available (basil, parsley).

**Chef - Finishing & Plating:**

Serve in bowls. Top with grated Parmesan if available.

## Meal 3: Marinated Steak 

**Protein:** Flat iron steak

**Ingredients:** White sweet potatoes, green cabbage, red onion

**Description:** Sous vide flat iron steak finished with torch, served with warm sweet potatoes and charred cabbage wedges.

**Instructions:**

**Already Prepped:**

 - Flat iron steaks have been seasoned and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.
 
 - White sweet potatoes have been vacuum sealed and cooked to perfect temperature. Stored in fridge ready to warm.

**Sous Chef - Prep:**

Drop the vacuum-sealed steaks into the sous vide bath set to steak temperature (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app, typically 130-135°F for medium-rare).

Drop the vacuum-sealed sweet potatoes into the same sous vide bath alongside the steaks to gently warm them.

Slice the red onion into rings (about ½-inch thick).

Cut the cabbage into thick wedges, cutting through the core/root end so each wedge holds together. This is important - the core keeps the leaves from falling apart.

Preheat oven to 500°F. Spread the sliced onion rings on a baking sheet with the white sweet potatoes from the bag. Toss everything with grapeseed oil and black pepper. Roast until caramelized and getting good color, about 15-20 minutes.

Once they look roasted, change the oven temp to warm, and add the plates to the oven alongside the veggies to keep them both warm until the chef gets home.

**Chef - Finishing & Plating:**

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Char the cabbage wedges on both sides until deeply golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.

Remove steaks from sous vide bag, reserving ALL the juices. Pat steaks completely dry. Using a kitchen torch, sear all sides until a nice crust forms.

In the same skillet used for cabbage, pour in the reserved steak bag juices. Reduce over medium-high heat until thickened into a glaze, scraping up any browned bits from the cabbage.

Slice the steak against the grain.

To plate: Arrange the roasted onions and sweet potato chunks on the plate. Fan the sliced steak over the top. Place the charred cabbage wedge alongside. Drizzle the reduced pan glaze over the steak and cabbage.


## Meal 5: Chicken Fricassée

**Protein:** Whole chicken

**Ingredients:** Collard greens, gold & red beets, pomegranate

**Description:** Chicken Fricassée (deconstructed whole chicken) served with braised collard greens, roasted beets, and garnished with pomegranate seeds and mustard vinaigrette; a satisfying, colorful meal.

**Instructions:**

**Already Prepped:**

 - Chicken has been spatchcocked, seasoned, and vacuum sealed flat with legs and thighs scored. Stored in fridge.

 -  Golden and red beets have been vacuum sealed and cooked to perfect temperature. Stored in fridge ready to warm.

 - Homemade wheat dough is resting in the fridge.

**Sous Chef - Prep:**

Put the wheat dough into the oven following the [King Arthur No-Knead Rustic Whole Wheat Bread Instructions](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/no-knead-rustic-whole-wheat-bread-recipe). Let cool for 1-2 hours.

Drop the vacuum-sealed chicken into the sous vide bath set to chicken temperature (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app).

Drop the vacuum-sealed beets into the same sous vide bath alongside the chicken to gently warm them.

Wash, stem, and chop the collard greens roughly. Set aside.

Prep a single pomegranate for the garnish.

Preheat the air fryer oven to 475°F.

**Chef - Finishing & Plating:**

With the air fryer oven now hot at 475°F. Spread the chopped collard greens in a roasting pan as a bed.

Remove chicken from sous vide bag, reserve all the juices from the bag; pat the chicken all dry and then carve off the breasts and set them aside for now. Place the remaining dark meat + carcass skin-side up on the collard green bed.

Roast the dark meat on the collard bed for 15 minutes until skin is golden and crispy. In the last 10 minutes, add the breasts back on top, so they can get crispy and hot as well

While chicken roasts, make the sauce: Pour the reserved sous vide chicken juices into a small saucepan. Add mustard, white wine, and Worcestershire sauce to taste.

To plate: Remove chicken from oven. Shred the dark meat (legs and thighs) off the bones and mix it into the wilted collard greens. Spread this mixture as the bed on the serving platter.

Slice the breast meat. Nestle the breast slices and warm beet chunks on top of the collard-dark meat bed.

Drizzle the warm mustard vinaigrette over everything and scatter pomegranate seeds on top for color and brightness.

Serve it with the homemade wheat bread and some butter.
