## Lamb Meatballs & Veg

**Protein:** Ground lamb

**Ingredients:** Frozen mire poix, onion paste/puree, parsley,white wine, microgreens

**Description:** Tender lamb meatballs served on a bed of sous vide mire poix, finished with a rich pan sauce made from the mire poix bag juices and meatball fond  + wine. Topped with fresh microgreens for brightness.

**Already Prepped:**

- Ground lamb is thawed.
- Frozen mire poix has been vacuum sealed and cooked sous vide to perfect tenderness. Stored in fridge ready to warm.

**Sous Chef - Prep:**

Make the lamb meatballs: Combine the thawed ground lamb with onion paste/puree (this will mellow the lamb flavor and add moisture). Season with salt, pepper, and any herbs you have on hand (oregano, thyme, or parsley work well). Form into even-sized meatballs, about 1.5 inches in diameter.

At serving time, warm the sous vide mire poix gently in its bag by dropping it in warm water or microwaving briefly. Once warm, open the bag and reserve ALL the cooking liquid for the sauce.

**Chef - Finishing & Plating:**

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides until they develop good color and are cooked through, about 8-10 minutes total. Remove meatballs and set aside.

Pour the reserved mire poix bag juices into the hot skillet, scraping up all the browned meatball fond. Add a generous splash of wine and reduce over medium-high heat until thickened into a glossy pan sauce, about 3-4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.

To plate: Spread the warm mire poix as a bed on each plate. Nestle the meatballs on top. Drizzle the pan sauce over everything. Top with a generous handful of fresh microgreens for a peppery, fresh finish.

Serve with bread if you have it

## Spiced Sheet Pan Fish

**Protein:** Frozen tilapia

**Ingredients:** Cherry tomatoes, red onion, garlic, harissa or warm spices, preserved or fresh lemon, olives (optional), couscous, parsley, extra virgin olive oil

**Description:** Frozen tilapia roasted at high heat with cherry tomatoes, red onion wedges, and warm North African spices. Served over garlic couscous with a bright parsley and olive oil finish.

**Already Prepped:**

- Frozen tilapia fillets (no need to thaw)

**Sous Chef - Cooking:**

Start the garlic couscous in the rice cooker: smash garlic cloves in the garlic press into the couscous, then add to rice cooker with water or chicken broth. Season it chicken boullion instead of salt, and some white pepper. Set to cook, let it stay on warm until ready to plate.

Preheat oven to 500°F. On a large sheet pan (don't overcrowd), arrange: frozen tilapia fillets, cherry tomatoes (whole or halved), red onion cut into thick wedges. Scatter olives around.

Season everything generously: drizzle with olive oil, add harissa paste, salt, and pepper. Add thin slices of preserved lemon or fresh lemon wedges tucked around the pan.

Roast for 15-18 minutes until tilapia is cooked through and tomatoes are bursting. The fish should flake easily and have golden edges (Z can poke test it?)

When done, turn oven to warm (or lowest setting) and leave the sheet pan in the oven. Keep couscous on warm in the rice cooker. Everything stays warm until Chef arrives.

**Chef - Finishing & Plating:**

Fluff the garlic couscous and spread as a bed on each plate. Nestle the roasted tilapia on top, along with the roasted tomatoes, onions, and any pan juices.

Roughly chop fresh parsley and scatter generously over everything. Finish with a generous drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon if needed.

## Sweet Pork Curry

**Protein:** Frozen ground pork

**Ingredients:** Potatoes, carrots, yellow onion, frozen peas, Japanese curry cubes + honey, ginger paste, panko breadcrumbs, Japanese rice, American bagged salad, Japanese dressing

**Description:** A weeknight-friendly take on Japanese pork katsu curry—ground pork simmered in rich curry sauce with potatoes and carrots, topped with toasted breadcrumbs for that katsu crunch. Served with Japanese rice and a simple salad. The honey adds a sweet, soft flavor to the curry.

**Already Prepped:**

- Ground pork is thawed.
- Potatoes, carrots, and onions are diced (1-inch cubes) and vacuum sealed together. Stored in fridge.

**Sous Chef - Prep:**

Drop the vacuum-sealed vegetables into the sous vide bath (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app to around 183°F for vegetables).

Toast the panko breadcrumbs: In a dry nonstick skillet over medium heat, toast panko until golden brown, stirring frequently. Set aside—they'll stay crispy.

At 5:30pm, start the Japanese rice in the rice cooker.

**Chef - Finishing & Plating:**

In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, brown the ground pork with a drizzle of oil, breaking it up as it cooks. Once browned, add ginger paste and onion paste/puree and honey and cook until fragrant.

Deglaze with cooking sake and add water or broth (about 3-4 cups) then bring to a simmer. Break up the Japanese curry cubes and stir them into the liquid until completely dissolved and the sauce thickens.

Add the already-cooked sous vide vegetables (along with the cooking liquid) and frozen peas. Stir gently and let everything heat through for 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Fluff the Japanese rice and serve in bowls. Ladle the curry over the rice generously.

Top each bowl with a generous sprinkle of the toasted panko breadcrumbs for that katsu crunch.

Serve the American bagged salad on the side, dressed with the Japanese dressing.
