## Chicken + Roots

##### SousVidePrep
###### 4:30 drop bags

#### Protein:
Chicken thighs

#### Ingredients:
Chicken thighs, Dijon mustard, garlic, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, olive oil, carrots, parsnips, yellow onions, arugula, lemon, French bread, butter

#### Description:
Tender chicken thighs sealed with Dijon, herbs, and garlic, sous vide ahead and finished with a hard sear or broiler blast. Root vegetables cooked sous vide separately and rewarmed alongside. Served with peppery arugula, torn French bread, and butter at the table. Comforting, filling, low night-of effort.

### Already Prepped

- Chicken thighs are seasoned with Dijon mustard, minced garlic, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Vacuum sealed and stored in fridge.
- Root vegetables (carrots, parsnips, yellow onions cut into chunks) are cooked sous vide with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Vacuum sealed and stored in fridge.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At 4:30pm, drop both the chicken thigh bags and the root vegetable bags into the sous vide bath (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app to 150°F for reheating).

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Remove chicken and vegetables from bags. Reserve all bag juices. Pat chicken thighs completely dry.

Heat a large skillet over high heat or preheat broiler. If using skillet, add a drizzle of oil and sear chicken thighs skin-side down until deeply golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Flip and sear other side. If using broiler, arrange thighs on a sheet pan skin-side up and broil until skin is blistered and golden, about 5-7 minutes.

Warm the root vegetables in a pan with their bag juices if desired, or plate directly.

Dress the arugula simply with lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper.

Plate: Arrange chicken thighs with root vegetables alongside. Big bowl of dressed arugula in the center of the table. Torn French bread and butter served family-style.

## Pork + Veg

##### SousChefDish
###### 4:30 drop pork + sheet pan

#### Protein:
Pork shoulder steaks or thick chops

#### Ingredients:
Pork shoulder steaks or thick chops, garlic, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, olive oil, red onion, cabbage, couscous, lemon

#### Description:
Pork sealed with Mediterranean herbs, garlic, and olive oil, sous vide ahead and reheated in the bath. Night-of, a sheet pan of cabbage wedges and red onions roasts hard while couscous cooks. Pork is sliced and finished with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon. Bright, hearty, satisfying.

### Already Prepped

- Pork is seasoned with minced garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Vacuum sealed and stored in fridge.

### Sous Chef - Cooking

At 4:30pm, drop the pork bags into the sous vide bath (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app to 140°F for reheating).

Preheat oven to 450°F.

Cut cabbage into thick wedges through the core so they hold together. Cut red onion into thick wedges through the root. Arrange on a large sheet pan. Drizzle generously with olive oil, season with salt and pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes until edges are charred and vegetables are tender.

Start couscous in the rice cooker: Add couscous with water or broth per package directions. Season with salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Set to cook and keep on warm.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Remove pork from bags. Reserve bag juices. Slice pork against the grain into thick slices.

Arrange sliced pork on a platter. Drizzle with reserved bag juices, a generous pour of good olive oil, and a squeeze of fresh lemon.

Fluff the couscous and spoon onto plates. Top with roasted vegetables and sliced pork. Make sure everyone gets some of that rich pork jus.

## Thai Beef Stir-Fry

##### Prep&Heat
###### 5:30 rice

#### Protein:
Ground beef

#### Ingredients:
Ground beef, red onion, garlic, fresh ginger, greens (kale or collards), soy sauce, fish sauce (optional), brown sugar, fresh basil or Thai basil, green onions, jasmine rice

#### Description:
Ground beef cooked hot and fast in a wide pan with aromatics. Big handfuls of hearty greens wilted directly into the fat. Seasoned with soy, optional fish sauce, and brown sugar for balance. Finished with basil or green onions. Served over rice. One-pan, aggressive, scalable.

### Already Prepped

- Ground beef is thawed.
- Aldi greens are ready.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At 5:30pm, start jasmine rice in the rice cooker.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Dice half a red onion. Mince plenty of garlic (at least 6 cloves). Grate or mince fresh ginger (about 2 tablespoons).

Heat a large wok or wide skillet over high heat with a drizzle of neutral oil. Add the ground beef and let it sit undisturbed for 2 minutes to get a good sear. Break it up and continue cooking until deeply browned.

Add the red onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Add big handfuls of the Aldi greens directly to the pan. They'll wilt down quickly in the fat. Stir to combine.

Season with soy sauce, a splash of fish sauce if using, and a spoonful of brown sugar. Taste and adjust—it should be savory, slightly sweet, with good depth.

Finish with torn fresh basil leaves or sliced green onions.

Serve over jasmine rice in bowls. Make sure the greens are well distributed.

## Curry Lentils

##### SousVidePrep
###### 4:30 drop bags + warm flatbread

#### Protein:
Lentils (meatless)

#### Ingredients:
Dried lentils, cauliflower, olive oil, bay leaves, garlic, yellow onion, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, garam masala, plain yogurt, lemon, red onion (for pickling), white vinegar, flatbreads or naan, fresh cilantro

#### Description:
Sous vide lentils and cauliflower cooked ahead, both warmed in the bath on the night. Lentils are finished with Indian spices and butter. Cauliflower gets a spice roast treatment. Build-your-own plates with yogurt sauce, pickled onions, and warm flatbreads. Abundant, substantial, and satisfying without feeling like a single lentil blob.

### Already Prepped

- Lentils are cooked sous vide with olive oil, bay leaf, minced garlic, salt, and water until tender. Vacuum sealed and stored in fridge.
- Cauliflower is cut into florets and cooked sous vide with olive oil, salt, ground cumin, ground coriander, and turmeric until tender. Vacuum sealed and stored in fridge.
- Quick pickled red onions: Use the jarred pickled red onions from the pantry, or thinly slice red onion and soak in white vinegar with a pinch of salt and sugar. Stored in fridge.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At 4:30pm, drop both the lentil bags and the cauliflower bags into the sous vide bath (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app to 150°F for reheating).

Make yogurt sauce: Whisk together plain yogurt, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Taste and adjust. Should be tangy and pourable. Store in fridge until serving.

Warm flatbreads in the oven or wrapped in foil when Chef arrives.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Remove lentils and cauliflower from bags. Reserve all bag liquids.

Warm lentils in a pot with their bag liquid. Add a knob of butter, ground cumin, garam masala, and a squeeze of lemon. Taste and adjust seasoning. Should be rich, earthy, and aromatic.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower florets and any bag liquid. Let them sizzle and get some color on the edges. Add more cumin, coriander, and garam masala to taste. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.

Plate family-style: Large bowl of spiced lentils, platter of roasted spiced cauliflower, bowl of yogurt sauce, bowl of pickled red onions, stack of warm flatbreads. Scatter fresh cilantro over everything.

Everyone builds their own plates—flatbread as the base, lentils and cauliflower piled on, drizzled with yogurt sauce, topped with pickled onions and cilantro.
