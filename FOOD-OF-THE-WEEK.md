## ✓ One-Pot Bison Ragu with Udon

##### Prep&Heat
###### 4:30 prep salad + chop

#### Protein:
Ground bison

#### Ingredients:
Ground bison, red onion, garlic, canned chopped tomatoes, brown rice udon noodles, bagged salad

#### Description:
A simple, deeply savory weeknight ragu—bison simmered with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, finished directly with udon noodles for a single-pot pasta situation. Paired with a no-effort bag salad.

### Already Prepped

- Ground bison is thawed.

### Sous Chef - Prep

Toss the bagged salad with some veg we have hanging around like shredded carrots, cherry tomatoes, etc. Chill in the fridge until ready to dress and plate.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Dice half a red onion and mince several cloves of garlic. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over high heat with neutral oil. Add the ground bison and brown hard, breaking it up as it cooks. Don't stir too much—let it get good color.

Once browned, add the onion and garlic. Cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes with their juices. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and let the sauce develop for 10-15 minutes.

Add the udon noodles directly to the pot along with a splash of water if needed. Stir to coat and cook until the noodles are tender and glossy with sauce, about 5 minutes.

Serve in bowls with the dressed salad on the side.

## Chicken Pot Pie

##### Prep&Heat+
###### 4:30 prep filling + bake

#### Protein:
Chicken breast

#### Ingredients:
Boneless skinless chicken breast, frozen cut green beans, whole carrots, heavy cream, butter, flour, chicken stock, fresh thyme and/or rosemary, green onions, puff pastry

#### Description:
A comforting weeknight pot pie with tender chicken, sweet carrots, and green beans in a creamy herb-laced sauce, topped with crisp golden puff pastry. All the warmth of classic pot pie with simplified execution.

### Already Prepped

- Chicken breast is thawed.
- Frozen green beans are ready.
- Puff pastry is thawed according to package directions.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At 4:30pm, peel and slice the carrots into coins. Cube the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Slice the green onions (both white and green parts). Strip fresh thyme leaves from stems (or finely chop rosemary).

Prep the puff pastry: Unfold thawed puff pastry and cut to fit your baking dish (or individual ramekins). Keep chilled until ready to use.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Preheat oven to 400°F.

In a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add the cubed chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook until just browned on the outside but not cooked through, about 3-4 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Add more butter if needed. Add the sliced carrots and cook for 3-4 minutes until starting to soften. Add the frozen green beans and white parts of the green onions. Cook another 2 minutes.

Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 1 minute. Gradually add chicken stock, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Add heavy cream and bring to a simmer. The sauce should thicken.

Return the chicken to the pan along with any juices. Add the fresh herbs. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

Lay the puff pastry over the filling, tucking edges down or letting them hang over. Cut a few slits in the top for steam to escape.

Bake for 20 minutes until the puff pastry is deeply golden and puffed, and the filling is bubbling around the edges.

Let rest for 5 minutes. Scatter sliced green onion tops over the golden crust before serving.

## Sheet Pan Sausage & Peppers

##### SousChefDish
###### prep ingredients + oven roast

#### Protein:
Italian sausage links

#### Ingredients:
Italian sausage links, bell peppers, red onion, garlic, olive oil, tomatoe paste,rolls

#### Description:
High-heat sheet pan roast of sausages with sweet bell peppers and red onion until blistered and juicy. Served simply with warm rolls for a hands-on, low-effort dinner.

### Already Prepped

- Italian sausage links are thawed.
- Rolls are ready.

### Sous Chef - Cooking

Preheat oven to 500°F.

Slice bell peppers into thick strips. Cut red onion into thick wedges through the root so they hold together. Smash several garlic cloves.

Arrange sausage links on a large sheet pan. Scatter the pepper strips, onion wedges, and smashed garlic around the sausages. Drizzle generously with olive oil and a tablespoon of tomato paste. Season vegetables with salt and pepper. Mash everything around until well coated

Roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping sausages halfway through, until the sausages are deeply browned and cooked through and the vegetables are soft and caramelized with charred edges.

Turn oven to warm or lowest setting to keep everything hot until Chef arrives to plate.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Warm the rolls in the oven briefly if desired.

Serve the roasted sausages and vegetables family-style on a platter, or pile into warm rolls for sausage sandwiches. Make sure everyone gets plenty of the sweet, blistered peppers and onions.
