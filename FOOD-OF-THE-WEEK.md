## Thai Beef Stir-Fry

##### Prep&Heat
###### 5:30 rice

#### Description:
Ground beef cooked hot and fast in a wide pan with aromatics. Big handfuls of hearty greens wilted directly into the fat. Seasoned with soy, optional fish sauce, and brown sugar for balance. Finished with basil or green onions. Served over rice. One-pan, aggressive, scalable.

### Already Prepped

- Ground beef is thawed.
- Aldi greens are ready.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At 5:30pm, start jasmine rice in the rice cooker.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Dice half a red onion. Mince plenty of garlic (at least 6 cloves). Grate or mince fresh ginger (about 2 tablespoons).

Heat a large wok or wide skillet over high heat with a drizzle of neutral oil. Add the ground beef and let it sit undisturbed for 2 minutes to get a good sear. Break it up and continue cooking until deeply browned.

Add the red onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Add big handfuls of the Aldi greens directly to the pan. They'll wilt down quickly in the fat. Stir to combine.

Season with soy sauce, a splash of fish sauce if using, and a spoonful of brown sugar. Taste and adjust—it should be savory, slightly sweet, with good depth.

Finish with torn fresh basil leaves or sliced green onions.

Serve over jasmine rice in bowls. Make sure the greens are well distributed.
