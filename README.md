## Meal 1: One Pot Pasta

**Protein:** Ground pork

**Ingredients:** Brown udon rice noodles, tomato paste, San Marzano tomatoes, frozen mixed mushrooms, frozen three pepper blend

**Description:** A hearty one-pot pasta that combines ground pork with rich tomato sauce, mushrooms, and peppers. Quick weeknight meal with minimal cleanup.

**Instructions:**

Brown the ground pork in a large pot or deep skillet with a drizzle of oil. Break it up as it cooks. Once browned, add aromatics (garlic, onion if you have them). Stir in the tomato paste and let it caramelize for a minute or two.

Add the San Marzano tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or a wooden spoon as you add them. Fill one of the empty cans halfway with water and add that too. Bring to a simmer.

Add the frozen mushrooms and frozen pepper blend directly from the freezer. Let everything simmer for 10-15 minutes to meld the flavors.

Add the udon noodles directly to the pot. Cook according to package directions, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender and have absorbed some of the sauce. If it gets too thick, add a splash of water.

Season with salt, pepper, and maybe a pinch of red pepper flakes. Finish with fresh herbs if you have them (basil, parsley). Serve in bowls with grated Parmesan if available.

## Meal 2: Broiled Steak Dinner

**Protein:** Flat iron steak

**Ingredients:** White sweet potatoes, green cabbage, red onion, Italian dressing marinade (at home)

**Description:** Marinated broiled flat iron steak served with roasted sweet potatoes and charred cabbage wedges. The vegetables cook alongside the steak under the broiler.

**Instructions:**

Marinate the flat iron steak in Italian dressing (or make a quick marinade with olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper) for at least 30 minutes, or up to a few hours in the fridge.

Cut the white sweet potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a sheet pan.

Cut the cabbage into thick wedges (through the core so they hold together). Slice the red onion into thick rings. Toss both with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange on the same sheet pan or a second one if needed.

Roast the vegetables at 425°F for about 20-25 minutes until the sweet potatoes are tender and starting to caramelize.

While vegetables are roasting, heat your broiler to high. Place the marinated steak on a broiler pan or oven-safe skillet. Broil 4-6 inches from the heat for 3-5 minutes per side, depending on thickness and desired doneness. Aim for medium-rare to medium.

In the last few minutes of steak cooking, you can slide the vegetable pan under the broiler too to get some char on the cabbage.

Let the steak rest for 5 minutes, then slice against the grain. Serve with the roasted vegetables.

## Meal 3: Stir Fry

**Protein:** Sirloin flap steak

**Ingredients:** Purple asparagus, bok choy microgreens, shallot, brown rice (at home)

**Description:** Quick stir fry with tender sirloin flap steak, purple asparagus, and aromatic shallot, finished with delicate bok choy microgreens. Served over brown rice.

**Instructions:**

Start the brown rice cooking according to package directions (or use a rice cooker). Your sister can handle this.

Slice the sirloin flap steak thinly against the grain. Season with salt and pepper. You can marinate briefly in soy sauce, a touch of cornstarch, and sesame oil if you have 10 minutes.

Trim the woody ends off the asparagus and cut into 2-inch pieces. Slice the shallot thinly.

Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add oil with a high smoke point (vegetable, grapeseed, or peanut oil).

Stir fry the beef in batches to avoid crowding—you want a good sear. Set aside on a plate.

In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir fry the shallot for 30 seconds until fragrant, then add the asparagus. Cook for 2-3 minutes, tossing frequently, until bright and tender-crisp.

Return the beef to the pan. Add a quick sauce: soy sauce, a splash of rice vinegar or rice wine, maybe a touch of honey or sugar, and garlic/ginger if you have them. Toss everything together for about 30 seconds.

Plate over the brown rice. Top with a generous handful of the bok choy microgreens—they'll wilt slightly from the heat and add a fresh, peppery finish.

## Meal 4: Roasted Chicken

**Protein:** Whole chicken

**Ingredients:** Collard greens, golden beets, red beets, pomegranate

**Description:** Classic roasted whole chicken served with braised collard greens, roasted beets, and garnished with bright pomegranate seeds. A satisfying, colorful meal.

**Instructions:**

Roast the chicken: Preheat oven to 425°F. Pat the chicken dry, season generously with salt, pepper, and any herbs you like (thyme, rosemary). Rub with olive oil or butter. Place in a roasting pan breast-side up. Roast for about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F in the thickest part of the thigh. Let rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.

Roast the beets: Wrap the golden and red beets separately in foil packets with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Roast alongside the chicken for about 45-60 minutes until tender when pierced with a knife. Once cool enough to handle, peel and cut into wedges or slices.

Braise the collard greens: While the chicken roasts, wash and stem the collard greens. Chop roughly. In a large pot or skillet, heat some olive oil or bacon fat if you have it. Sauté a chopped onion (if available) until soft, then add the collards. Add a cup or two of chicken broth or water, season with salt, pepper, and a splash of vinegar or hot sauce if you like. Cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes until tender.

Open the pomegranates and extract the seeds (arils). This can be done by cutting the pomegranate in half and tapping the back with a wooden spoon over a bowl.

To serve: Carve the chicken and plate with the braised collard greens and roasted beets. Scatter pomegranate seeds over the top for a burst of color and sweetness.
