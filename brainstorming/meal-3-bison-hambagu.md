##### Prep&Heat+
###### 5:00 form patties + roast potatoes + prep salad

#### Protein:
Ground bison

#### Ingredients:
Ground bison, panko breadcrumbs, egg, green onions, garlic, ginger paste, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, mirin, sake, sweet potatoes, mixed salad greens, shredded carrots, cucumber, Japanese sesame dressing, butter

#### Description:
Japanese-style hamburg steak made with lean ground bison, pan-fried until caramelized and finished with a glossy umami glaze that hits all the notes—sweet from ketchup and mirin, savory from soy and worcestershire, tangy from the reduction. Served yoshoku-style with roasted potato wedges and a crisp side salad with Japanese sesame dressing. Japanese family restaurant style comfort food.

### Already Prepped
- Ground bison is thawed.
- Sweet potatoes are cut into thick wedges and ready to roast.

### Sous Chef - Prep

Preheat oven to 425°F for the sweet potato wedges.

Form the bison patties: In a large bowl, combine ground bison with panko breadcrumbs, one beaten egg, finely chopped green onions (use the whites, and reserve some of the green parts for garnish), minced garlic, ginger paste, salt, and white pepper. Mix gently but thoroughly. Form into 4-5 oval patties, slightly flattened (classic hambagu shape). Make a small indent in the center of each patty to prevent puffing. Refrigerate until cooking.

Toss sweet potato wedges generously with oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a sheet pan and roast for 30-35 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and crispy.

Prep the salad: Combine mixed greens, shredded carrots, and thinly sliced cucumber in a bowl. Keep refrigerated and undressed until serving.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Heat a large skillet over medium heat with a drizzle of oil. Add the bison patties and cook until deeply browned on both sides and cooked through, about 4-5 minutes per side. Bison is lean, so avoid overcooking. Remove patties to a plate.

Make the glaze in the same pan: Add worcestershire sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, mirin, and sake (roughly equal parts, about 2 tablespoons each, adjust to taste). Stir and scrape up all the browned bits. Let it bubble and reduce until thick and glossy, about 2-3 minutes. Swirl in a small knob of butter for richness. Return patties to the pan and coat in the glaze.

Dress the salad with Japanese sesame dressing right before serving.

Plate: Roasted sweet potato wedges, glazed bison hambagu with extra glaze spooned over, side salad. Garnish the patties with sliced green onions.
