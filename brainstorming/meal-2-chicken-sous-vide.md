# Meal 2: Sous Vide Chicken & Veg

##### Prep&Heat
###### 5:00 drop bags + make rice

#### Protein:
Chicken breast

#### Ingredients:
Chicken breast, green beans, carrots, garlic, butter, white wine, chicken stock, fresh herbs (thyme and/or rosemary), jasmine rice

#### Description:
A streamlined sous vide dinner where both protein and vegetables are already cooked and sealed—sous chef simply drops both bags in the bath to warm together. Chef finishes with a quick sear on the chicken and a simple pan sauce made from the bag juices. Served with fluffy rice and the perfectly cooked vegetables.

### Already Prepped
- Chicken breasts have been seasoned (salt, pepper, garlic, herbs) and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.
- Green beans and carrots have been cooked sous vide (butter, garlic, salt) and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At 4:30pm, drop both the chicken bag and the vegetable bag into the sous vide bath (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app to 153°F for reheating).

Start jasmine rice in the rice cooker.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Remove chicken and vegetables from bags. Reserve all bag juices (both chicken and veg). Pat chicken completely dry.

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. Sear chicken breasts on both sides until deeply golden, about 2-3 minutes per side.

Remove chicken to rest. In the same skillet, add reserved bag juices, a splash of white wine, and a splash of chicken stock. Reduce over medium-high heat, scraping up browned bits, until thickened into a glossy pan sauce. Swirl in a knob of butter. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Warm the sous vide vegetables briefly in the pan if needed, or plate directly.

Plate: Fluffy rice as a base, sliced chicken breast fanned on top, vegetables alongside. Spoon the pan sauce over the chicken and rice. Scatter fresh herbs if desired.
