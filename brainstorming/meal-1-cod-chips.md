Crispy panko-crusted cod shallow-fried to golden perfection, served with oven-roasted chips and a bright, crunchy winter slaw dressed with jalapeño olive oil and white balsamic. A deconstructed fish and chips elevated with fresh vegetables and bold flavors, finished with a simple lemon-herb white sauce.

### Already Prepped
- Cod fillets are thawed and ready.
- Potatoes have been cut into chips, boiled until nearly falling apart, and are sitting exposed to air on a sheet pan in the fridge (for maximum crispiness).
- Bagged shaved brussels sprouts are ready.
- Fire roasted corn is in a can, ready to use.

### Sous Chef - Cooking

Prep the slaw vegetables: Thinly slice half a red onion. Chop half a bunch of parsley. Shred a quarter of a red cabbage into thin strips. Combine in a large bowl with the shaved brussels sprouts and drained fire roasted corn. Leave undressed and store in fridge until Chef assembles.

Set up breading station with three shallow dishes: flour, beaten eggs, and panko breadcrumbs.

Pat cod fillets completely dry. Salt each side properly. Dredge each fillet in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg, letting excess drip off. Press firmly into panko to coat both sides thoroughly.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat with about ¼ inch of neutral oil. When oil shimmers, add breaded cod fillets. Shallow fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side, until fish flakes easily. Remove to paper towel-lined plate, transfer finished fillets to a wire rack set in a low oven to keep warm.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss the prepped potato chips generously with plenty of neutral oil and spread on a sheet pan in a single layer. Season with salt. Roast for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway, until deeply golden and crispy.

Make the white sauce: Whisk together mayo, fresh lemon juice, and finely chopped fresh dill. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and white pepper. Should be drizzlable.

Dress the slaw: Toss the prepared vegetables with white balsamic vinegar and jalapeño olive oil to taste. Season with salt and pepper. The slaw should be bright and punchy.

Plate each serving: Pile of oven-fried chips, crispy panko cod alongside, generous mound of dressed slaw. Drizzle the white sauce over everything.
