# Meal 4: Stir-Fried Shrimp Scampi

##### Prep&Heat
###### cut vegetables + boil noodles

#### Protein:
Gulf shrimp (31-40 ct)

#### Ingredients:
Gulf shrimp, garlic, asparagus, celery (with leaves), red bell pepper, egg noodles, butter, white wine, lemon, fresh parsley, red pepper flakes

#### Description:
A fast stir-fried take on shrimp scampi that swaps spaghetti for egg noodles and adds quick-cooking vegetables for color and crunch. High heat, garlic butter, white wine, and lemon create that classic scampi flavor while asparagus, celery, and bell pepper keep it light and vegetal. The celery leaves add an herbaceous finish. Weeknight speed with restaurant flavors.

### Already Prepped
- Shrimp are thawed and deveined.

### Sous Chef - Prep

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the egg noodles.

Prep all vegetables: Cut asparagus into 2-inch pieces on the bias. Slice celery thinly on the bias (reserve the leaves, roughly chopped). Slice red bell pepper into thin strips. Mince plenty of garlic (at least 6 cloves).

Cook egg noodles according to package directions. Drain and toss with a little butter or oil to prevent sticking. Set aside.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Heat a large wok or skillet over high heat with a drizzle of oil. Add asparagus, celery, and bell pepper. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until vegetables are crisp-tender and lightly charred. Remove to a plate.

Add a bit more oil to the same pan, still over high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer, season with salt and pepper. Let them sear undisturbed for about 1 minute, then flip and cook another minute until just pink and cooked through. Remove shrimp to the plate with vegetables.

Reduce heat to medium. Add butter and minced garlic to the pan. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add white wine and a squeeze of lemon juice. Let it bubble and reduce slightly, scraping up any browned bits.

Return shrimp and vegetables to the pan along with the cooked egg noodles. Toss everything together in the garlic butter sauce. Add red pepper flakes to taste. Finish with chopped fresh parsley and the reserved celery leaves.

Plate in bowls, making sure everyone gets plenty of that garlic butter sauce. Serve with extra lemon wedges on the side.
