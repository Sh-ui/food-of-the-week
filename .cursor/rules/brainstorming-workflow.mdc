# Brainstorming Workflow

Rules for using the `brainstorming/` folder during weekly meal planning sessions.

<rule>
name: brainstorming-workflow
description: Standards for how the brainstorming folder is used in the weekly planning cycle

workflow:
  purpose: "Free-form weekly planning and ideation space"
  
  process:
    1: "Each week, brainstorming starts in the `brainstorming/` folder"
    2: "Files can be any format (.md, .txt, or other) for maximum flexibility"
    3: "This week's work stays in `brainstorming/` until finalized"
    4: "Once finalized, content is structured and moved to `FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md`"
    5: "Old brainstorming files can be kept for reference or cleared week-to-week"

folder_structure:
  location: "PROJECT_ROOT/brainstorming/"
  
  subdirectories:
    idea_basis:
      path: "brainstorming/idea-basis/"
      purpose: "Reference documents containing meal planning paradigms, inspirations, and established patterns"
      usage: "Consult these files when brainstorming to understand user's cooking style, preferences, and planning approach"
      examples:
        - "meal-planning.txt - Core planning principles"
        - "f-word-inspo.txt - Flavor inspiration sources"
        - "quick-meal.txt - Fast weeknight patterns"
        - "RULE-FRAME.md - Planning framework"
    
    old_ideas:
      path: "brainstorming/old-ideas/"
      purpose: "Archive for completed week's brainstorming files"
      usage: "Move files from brainstorming/ root to old-ideas/ when starting a new week to keep workspace clean"
      cleanup: "Files can be kept for reference or deleted as needed"
  
  root_files:
    description: "Free-form workspace for current week's brainstorming"
    file_naming:
      flexibility: "Any naming convention works - prioritize clarity"
      examples:
        - "grocery-list.md"
        - "meal-plan.md"
        - "ideas-dec-7.txt"
        - "this-week-notes.md"
        - "stuff-we-have.txt"
        - "stuff-coming.txt"
  
  file_formats:
    markdown: "Preferred for structured content"
    text: "Good for quick notes and freeform thinking"
    other: "Any format that helps thinking process"

usage_patterns:
  during_brainstorming:
    - "Review brainstorming/idea-basis/ files for context on user's planning paradigms and inspirations"
    - "Capture raw ideas and ingredient lists"
    - "Sketch out meal combinations"
    - "Note proteins available and needed"
    - "Draft grocery lists"
    - "Experiment with recipe structures"
    - "Reference established patterns from idea-basis when suggesting meals"
  
  context_sources:
    - "brainstorming/idea-basis/meal-planning.txt - Core planning principles"
    - "brainstorming/idea-basis/f-word-inspo.txt - Flavor inspiration"
    - "brainstorming/idea-basis/quick-meal.txt - Fast weeknight patterns"
    - "brainstorming/idea-basis/RULE-FRAME.md - Planning framework"
    - "Any other files in idea-basis/ that contain relevant paradigms"
  
  state: "Work-in-progress, informal, exploratory"
  audience: "User and AI assistant only"

finalization_process:
  trigger: "When weekly plan is decided and ready to publish"
  
  steps:
    - "Structure content according to FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md standards"
    - "Format grocery list with proper categories"
    - "Write meal descriptions in final form"
    - "Move finalized content to FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md"
    - "Optionally clean up or archive brainstorming files"

archiving_process:
  trigger: "When archiving FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md to archive/ folder"
  
  steps:
    1: "Copy entire FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md content"
    2: "Create new file: archive/YYYYMMDDsummary.md"
    3: "Remove all strikethroughs from meal names (e.g., '~~Meal 1: Name~~' → 'Meal 1: Name')"
    4: "Remove strikethroughs from any other content that may have been marked as completed"
    5: "Paste cleaned content into archive file"
    6: "Update FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md with next week's content"
  
  strikethrough_removal:
    pattern: "~~text~~"
    examples:
      - "~~Meal 1: One Pot Pasta~~" → "Meal 1: One Pot Pasta"
      - "## ~~Meal 2: Stir Fry~~" → "## Meal 2: Stir Fry"
    scope: "All meal headings and any other strikethrough text in the document"
    reason: "Archive files should preserve the final plan without completion markers"

maintenance:
  weekly_cleanup:
    process:
      1: "After finalizing week and moving content to FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md"

      3: "Keep idea-basis/ folder untouched (it's reference material, not weekly work)"
      4: "Start fresh week's brainstorming in brainstorming/ root"
    
    options:
      keep_in_old_ideas: "Retain files in old-ideas/ for historical reference"
