Rules for using the `brainstorming/` folder during weekly meal planning sessions.

<rule>
name: brainstorming-workflow
description: Standards for how the brainstorming folder is used in the weekly planning cycle

workflow:
  purpose: "Free-form weekly planning and ideation space"
  
  process:
    1: "Each week, brainstorming starts in the `brainstorming/` folder"
    2: "Files can be any format (.md, .txt, or other) for maximum flexibility"
    3: "This week's work stays in `brainstorming/` until finalized"
    4: "Once finalized, content is structured and moved to `README.md`"
    5: "Old brainstorming files can be kept for reference or cleared week-to-week"

folder_structure:
  location: "PROJECT_ROOT/brainstorming/"
  
  file_naming:
    flexibility: "Any naming convention works - prioritize clarity"
    examples:
      - "grocery-list.md"
      - "meal-plan.md"
      - "ideas-dec-7.txt"
      - "this-week-notes.md"
  
  file_formats:
    markdown: "Preferred for structured content"
    text: "Good for quick notes and freeform thinking"
    other: "Any format that helps thinking process"

usage_patterns:
  during_brainstorming:
    - "Capture raw ideas and ingredient lists"
    - "Sketch out meal combinations"
    - "Note proteins available and needed"
    - "Draft grocery lists"
    - "Experiment with recipe structures"
  
  state: "Work-in-progress, informal, exploratory"
  audience: "User and AI assistant only"

finalization_process:
  trigger: "When weekly plan is decided and ready to publish"
  
  steps:
    - "Structure content according to README standards"
    - "Format grocery list with proper categories"
    - "Write meal descriptions in final form"
    - "Move finalized content to README.md"
    - "Optionally clean up or archive brainstorming files"

maintenance:
  weekly_cleanup:
    options:
      keep: "Retain files for historical reference"
      clear: "Delete to start fresh next week"
      archive: "Move to a timestamped subfolder if desired"
    
    recommendation: "User preference - no strict rule"

actions:

    do:
      - "Create files in brainstorming/ for ideation"
      - "Keep format loose and conversational"
      - "Focus on capturing ideas, not perfect formatting"
  
  - type: guide

      - "Ensure all required sections are present"
      - "Apply proper formatting standards"
  
  - type: inform
    when: "User asks about file organization"
    do:
      - "Explain brainstorming/ is for work-in-progress"
      - "README.md is for finalized, published content"
      - "Archive/ is for historical weekly plans"
