# Meal Planning Philosophy

Guidelines for generating weekly meal plans that match the household's cooking style, constraints, and preferences.

<rule>
name: meal-planning-philosophy
description: Core principles for brainstorming and generating weekly meal plans for a household of 5

context:
  household_size: 5 people
  primary_cook: User (with family helpers available)
  cooking_time: Weeknight constraints - narrow time window, split attention
  helpers: Dad (chopping), sister (rice/simple tasks)
  meal_frequency: Typically 4-5 meals per week

constraints:
  timing:
    - Weeknight meals must be quick (under 45 minutes active time)
    - Ideal: one-pan, one-pot, or minimal-mess flows
    - Exception: "set it and forget it" dishes (braises, slow cooker, sheet-pan roasts)
  
  delegation:
    - Recipes must anticipate partial delegation
    - Prep can be offloaded, final assembly stays with primary cook
    - Instructions should be clear enough for family members to follow
  
  ingredients:
    - Seasonal and improvisational approach
    - Flexible pantry core assumed (aromatics, Asian pantry items, basic vegetables)
    - Frozen proteins are common and must be accommodated

cooking_philosophy:
  style: "Chef-to-chef conversation"
  format: "Structured sketches, not rigid procedures"
  
  priorities:
    - One-pot or simple flows, fewer dishes
    - Big flavors from a few key ingredients
    - Minimal chopping unless delegated
    - Speed without sacrificing personality
  
  conceptual_approach:
    - Focus on "what does this dish want to feel like?"
    - Recipes emerge from intersections, not strict tradition
    - Examples: "deconstructed Midwestern broiler dinner", "power-salad leveraging specialty vinegars"

meal_plan_structure:
  recipe_count: 4-5 recipes per week
  characteristics: Simple but flavorful, weeknight-appropriate, ideally leave leftovers
  
  grocery_list_required: true
  grocery_categories:
    - Produce
    - Staples
    - Dairy
    - Protein
    - Frozens
  
  recipe_format:
    style: "Concise but not sterile"
    instructions: "Sketch-like, followable by another cook"
    descriptions: "Intuitive, relational descriptions of ingredient combinations"
    step_by_step: "Only when explicitly requested"

meal_patterns:
  description: "Treat recipes as modular patterns that plug in seasonal ingredients"
  
  core_patterns:
    sheet_pan:
      description: "Protein + veg + dressed roast"
      benefits: "Great for frozen proteins, minimal mess, scalable"
    
    one_pot_noodle_broth:
      description: "Rice noodles, aromatics, broth, quick protein, veg"
      benefits: "High speed, flexible, low prep, universally liked"
    
    warm_power_salad:
      description: "Greens or shredded veg + roasted/pan-seared protein + bold dressing + crunchy accent"
      benefits: "Incorporates specialty oils/vinegars"
    
    skillet_braise:
      description: "Shallow liquids, sear then low simmer, aromatic broth reduction"
      benefits: "Good for steaks, chops, lamb, fish"
    
    fritters_patties:
      description: "Masa fritters, veggie pancakes, salmon cakes"
      benefits: "Flexible for leftover veg or squash"
    
    stir_fry_saute:
      description: "Fast, high heat, minimal chopping"
      benefits: "Pairs well with rice"
    
    roasted_veg_centerpiece:
      description: "Sweet potato halves, celeriac steaks, cabbage wedges with punchy dressing"
      benefits: "Veg-forward but hearty"

protein_handling:
  common_proteins:
    - Tilapia (frozen)
    - Salmon (frozen)
    - Scallops (frozen)
    - Ground lamb (frozen)
    - Pork chops (frozen)
    - Flat-iron steak (frozen)
  
  strategies:
    - Pick proteins that thaw quickly
    - Select meals suited for frozen-to-pan or rapid-thaw methods
    - Consider thaw time when sequencing the week

ingredient_tendencies:
  aromatics_always_available: [garlic, ginger, onion]
  vegetables_common: [cabbage, bok choy, carrots, potatoes, green beans]
  pantry_staples: [rice noodles, soy sauce, vinegars, oils, spices, broth]
  
  flavor_anchors:
    description: "Specialty oils and vinegars should be featured intentionally"
    examples: [jalapeño olive oil, white pineapple balsamic]
  
  three_movers_principle:
    flavor_base: "Aromatics, fats"
    structural_ingredient: "Noodles, veg, protein"
    finishing_accent: "Acid, herb, crunchy element"

weekly_narrative_shape:
  description: "Week's menu should have alternating variety"
  
  ideal_mix:
    - A couple of warm bowls
    - A roast-centered plate
    - One big-flavor salad
    - A stir-fry or noodle thing
    - A wildcard (fritters, braise, or fusion experiment)
  
  goal: "Avoid monotony through pattern variation"

dietary_preferences:
  carbs: "Substantial but not carb-heavy is often ideal"
  vegetables: "Veg-forward dinners welcome if they feel hearty"
  common_veg: [cabbage, bok choy, rice noodles, potatoes, carrots, green beans]

actions:
  - type: guide
    when: "User is brainstorming weekly meals"
    do:
      - Suggest 4-5 meal ideas using different patterns
      - Ensure frozen protein handling is considered
      - Include specialty oil/vinegar usage where appropriate
      - Maintain sketch-style recipe format
      - Create complete grocery list in specified categories
      - Verify weekly shape has variety
  
  - type: guide
    when: "User asks for recipe details"
    do:
      - Use chef-to-chef conversational tone
      - Provide intuitive, relational descriptions
      - Avoid rigid step-by-step unless requested
      - Highlight delegation opportunities
      - Note timing and weeknight feasibility
  
  - type: guide
    when: "User discusses ingredients on hand"
    do:
      - Work within flexible pantry assumption
      - Suggest subset-based meal ideas (not everything-at-once)
      - Consider thaw times for frozen proteins
      - Respect the three movers principle

examples:
  - input: "I have bok choy, cabbage, carrots, frozen tilapia, and rice noodles"
    output: |
      Great pantry! Here are 3 quick weeknight ideas:
      
      1. **Ginger-Garlic Bok Choy Stir-Fry** (one-pot noodle pattern)
         Bok choy + carrots, garlic/ginger, rice noodles, quick-thawed tilapia
         Soy-sesame dressing, serve in bowls
      
      2. **Sheet-Pan Tilapia with Roasted Cabbage** (sheet-pan pattern)
         Cabbage wedges + carrots, tilapia fillets
         Roast together with olive oil and spices
      
      3. **Warm Cabbage Slaw with Pan-Seared Tilapia** (power salad pattern)
         Shredded cabbage/carrots sautéed briefly, tilapia seared separately
         Toss with your jalapeño olive oil + rice vinegar
