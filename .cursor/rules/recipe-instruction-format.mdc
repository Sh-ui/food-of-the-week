# Recipe Instruction Format

Guidelines for structuring recipe instructions in the three-phase workflow format that matches the household's actual cooking process.

<rule>
name: recipe-instruction-format
description: Three-phase instruction structure for meal recipes

philosophy:
  context: "Recipes should reflect the real workflow - what's prepped ahead, what helpers do, and what the primary cook finishes"
  goal: "Clear delegation and timing for efficient weeknight cooking"

instruction_structure:
  phases:
    already_prepped:
      label: "### Already Prepped"
      format: "H3 heading followed by bulleted list with ' - ' prefix"
      purpose: "Items prepared in advance (often sous vide, vacuum sealed, or batch prepped)"
      examples:
        - "Proteins: vacuum sealed and seasoned"
        - "Vegetables: pre-cooked sous vide and ready to warm"
        - "Dough: resting in fridge"
        - "Components: sauces made ahead, items thawed"
    
    sous_chef:
      label: "### Sous Chef - Prep" or "### Sous Chef - Cooking"
      format: "H3 heading followed by paragraph instructions"
      purpose: "Tasks family members can do before primary cook arrives"
      timing: "Done while primary cook is at work or occupied"
      examples:
        - "Starting sous vide baths with remote temperature control"
        - "Chopping vegetables"
        - "Starting rice or bread baking"
        - "Basic cooking tasks for simple dishes"
      delegation_notes:
        - "Instructions should be clear enough for any family member"
        - "Use specific measurements and timing"
        - "Note when Chef will set temperature remotely"
    
    chef_finishing:
      label: "### Chef - Finishing & Plating"
      format: "H3 heading followed by paragraph instructions"
      purpose: "Final cooking, searing, sauce-making, and plating"
      timing: "Done by primary cook when home"
      techniques:
        - "Torch-searing sous vide proteins"
        - "High-heat finishing (charring, crisping)"
        - "Sauce reduction and glazing"
        - "Final assembly and plating"

formatting_rules:
  already_prepped:
    - "Use bulleted list format"
    - "Start each item with ' - ' (space, dash, space)"
    - "Be specific about storage location and state"
    - "Example: ' - Flat iron steaks have been seasoned and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.'"
  
  sous_chef:
    - "Use clear, actionable paragraphs"
    - "Specify temperatures when using sous vide"
    - "Note when Chef will control remotely"
    - "Be explicit about cutting techniques (e.g., 'through the core so wedges hold together')"
    - "Include timing when relevant"
  
  chef_finishing:
    - "Write in active, direct style"
    - "Include sensory cues (golden, crispy, reduced, thickened)"
    - "Describe plating composition"
    - "Note any saucing or garnishing"

recipe_patterns:
  sous_vide_protein:
    already_prepped: "Protein vacuum sealed and seasoned"
    sous_chef: "Drop in sous vide bath (temperature set remotely), prep vegetables"
    chef: "Torch-sear protein, char vegetables, make sauce from bag juices, plate"
  
  one_pot_meal:
    already_prepped: "Proteins thawed"
    sous_chef: "Complete cooking of entire dish"
    chef: "Final seasoning check, serve/plate"
  
  complex_plate:
    already_prepped: "Multiple components pre-cooked or prepped"
    sous_chef: "Warm components, prep fresh elements, start breads/grains"
    chef: "Final cooking techniques, sauce making, composed plating"

technique_vocabulary:
  sous_vide:
    - "Drop vacuum-sealed [item] into sous vide bath"
    - "Chef will set temperature remotely from the app"
    - "Remove from bag, reserve juices"
    - "Pat completely dry before searing"
  
  finishing:
    - "Using a kitchen torch, sear until crust forms"
    - "Char on both sides until deeply golden"
    - "Reduce over medium-high heat until thickened into a glaze"
    - "Scraping up browned bits"
  
  plating:
    - "Arrange as a bed/base"
    - "Nestle [item] alongside/on top"
    - "Fan sliced [protein]"
    - "Drizzle [sauce] over"
    - "Scatter [garnish] on top"

linking_external_recipes:
  when: "For complex sub-recipes (bread, specialty techniques)"
  format: "[Recipe Name](URL)"
  example: "[King Arthur No-Knead Rustic Whole Wheat Bread Instructions](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/)"
  placement: "Within Sous Chef section where timing is relevant"

special_notes:
  cutting_instructions:
    importance: "Be specific about technique when structure matters"
    examples:
      - "Cut through the core/root end so each wedge holds together"
      - "Slice against the grain"
      - "½-inch thick rings"
  
  remote_control:
    sous_vide_apps: "Note when Chef sets temperature remotely"
    timing: "Allows sous chef to focus on prep without worrying about settings"

actions:
  - type: enforce
    when: "Writing or editing meal instructions"
    do:
      - "Use all three phases for every recipe"
      - "Use H3 headings for each phase (no colons)"
      - "Format Already Prepped as bulleted list"
      - "Format Sous Chef and Chef sections as paragraphs"
      - "Be specific about delegation boundaries"
      - "Include sensory and visual cues"
  
  - type: guide
    when: "Brainstorming new recipes"
    do:
      - "Think through the workflow first"
      - "Identify what can be prepped ahead"
      - "Consider what family members can handle"
      - "Reserve final techniques for primary cook"
      - "Plan for minimal equipment/dish usage"
  
  - type: suggest
    when: "User describes a recipe conversationally"
    do:
      - "Parse the workflow into three phases"
      - "Clarify delegation points"
      - "Add specific timing and temperatures"
      - "Format according to standards"

examples:
  minimal_delegation:
    name: "One Pot Pasta"
    already_prepped: "Just thawed protein"
    sous_chef: "Complete cooking"
    chef: "Serve and plate"
  
  moderate_delegation:
    name: "Stir Fry"
    already_prepped: "Thawed protein"
    sous_chef: "Start rice, prep all ingredients (slice, chop)"
    chef: "High-heat cooking, saucing, plating"
  
  advanced_delegation:
    name: "Sous Vide Steak Dinner"
    already_prepped: "Steaks and vegetables vacuum sealed and pre-cooked"
    sous_chef: "Start sous vide baths, roast vegetables, prep garnishes"
    chef: "Torch-sear protein, char vegetables, make sauce, composed plating"
  
  complex_multitasking:
    name: "Chicken Fricassée"
    already_prepped: "Spatchcocked chicken, cooked beets, bread dough"
    sous_chef: "Sous vide proteins, bake bread, chop greens, prep garnish"
    chef: "Roast chicken to crisp skin, make sauce, shred meat, composed plating"
