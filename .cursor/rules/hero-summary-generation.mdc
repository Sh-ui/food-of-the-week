# Hero Summary Generation

Guidelines for generating concise, actionable hero summaries from weekly meal plans that provide glance-able workload categorization and timing details for family users.

<rule>
name: hero-summary-generation
description: Process for analyzing meal plans and generating hero section summaries with codenames and complementary timing details

context:
  workflow_position: "Final step in weekly planning workflow, after brainstorming and FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md finalization"
  user_problem: "Family users need quick mental model of meal workloads without reading full recipes"
  solution: "Generate structured summary bullets: 'Meal Name • Codename • Complementary details'"
  output_format: "Bullet points for hero section, auto-generated from parsed meal data"
  source_location: "Hero summary should be added as bold lines immediately after the week title (H1) and before the first H2 section in FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md"

meal_codenames:
  definition: "Sous chef-centric workload categories conveying effort level and role distribution"
  
  categories:
    prep_and_heat:
      codename: "Prep&Heat"
      description: "Basic chopping/prep + simple heating/cooking"
      indicators:
        - Sous chef: chopping, basic setup, simple heating
        - Chef: primary cooking, assembly, plating
        - Time: 15-25 minutes total
        - Complexity: Low, mostly assembly work
      examples:
        - Tostadas with prepped meat/beans
        - Simple stir-fries with sliced ingredients
        - Basic assembly with pre-made components
    
    sous_vide_prep:
      codename: "SousVidePrep"
      description: "Sous vide setup with supporting prep work"
      indicators:
        - Sous chef: sous vide starts, vegetable prep, supporting tasks
        - Chef: searing, sauce-making, final cooking
        - Time: 30-45 minutes + timed sous vide elements
        - Complexity: Moderate, requires timing coordination
      examples:
        - Mire poix sous vide + patty forming
        - Vegetable sous vide + rice cooker setup
        - Chicken/beet sous vide + topping toasting
    
    sous_chef_dish:
      codename: "SousChefDish"
      description: "Sous chef owns complete dish execution with chef handling final touches"
      indicators:
        - Sous chef: full cooking process, multiple steps
        - Chef: plating, final seasoning, presentation
        - Time: 25-40 minutes, sous chef does bulk of work
        - Complexity: Moderate-heavy, sous chef takes ownership
      examples:
        - Complete pasta/one-pot cooking by sous chef
        - Full sheet pan setup and roasting
        - Oven-based dishes with sous chef managing timing
    
    intensity_modifiers:
      plus_system: "Add '+' for increased complexity/effort"
      single_plus: "+"
        conditions: "Extra prep steps, multiple components, or extended time"
        examples: "Sous Vide Prep +" for mire poix + patty forming
      double_plus: "++"  
        conditions: "Complex multi-step work, bread-making, extensive prep"
        examples: "Sous Vide Prep ++" for bread + sous vide + multiple elements

complementary_timing_details:
  purpose: "Provide actionable 'when/what' details that codename doesn't cover"
  principle: "Focus on key actions/timing that affect sous chef scheduling"
  
  extraction_rules:
    identify_key_actions:
      - "Sous vide start times (e.g., '4pm mire poix')"
      - "Timed cooking elements (e.g., '5:30pm rice cooker')"
      - "Multiple component coordination (e.g., '3:30pm veg + 5:30pm rice')"
      - "Prep timing that affects chef arrival (e.g., '5pm patties')"
      - "Tool operations (e.g., 'Couscous + oven roast')"
    
    prioritize_critical_timing:
      - "Sous vide drops (most time-sensitive)"
      - "Rice cooker starts (affects dinner timing)"
      - "Oven operations (hands-off but time-bound)"
      - "Complex prep sequences (bread-making, extensive chopping)"
    
    avoid_redundancy:
      - "Don't repeat technique from codename (e.g., don't say 'sous vide' after 'Sous Vide Prep')"
      - "Focus on 'when' and 'what specific' rather than general technique"
      - "Omit details that are obvious from codename"
    
    format_patterns:
      single_action: "4pm mire poix"
      sequential_actions: "3:30pm veg + 5:30pm rice"
      component_focus: "Couscous + full roast"
      prep_timing: "5pm patties"

analysis_workflow:
  step_by_step:
    step_1_scan_meals:
      action: "Read all meal sections in FOOD-OF-THE-WEEK.md"
      focus: "Sous Chef sections primarily, Chef sections for context"
    
    step_2_determine_codenames:
      action: "Analyze sous chef workload patterns"
      criteria:
        - "Count active cooking steps vs. prep steps"
        - "Check for sous vide elements"
        - "Assess ownership level (setup vs. complete dish)"
        - "Evaluate time commitment and complexity"
      assignment:
        - "Prep & Heat: Basic prep + simple cooking"
        - "Sous Vide Prep: Sous vide focus with prep"
        - "Sous Chef Dish: Sous chef owns dish"
        - "Add + for extra complexity, ++ for extensive work"
    
    step_3_extract_timing:
      action: "Identify 1-2 critical timing details per meal"
      priority: "Sous vide starts, rice cooker, oven operations, complex prep"
      format: "Keep concise, actionable, non-redundant"
    
    step_4_format_output:
      action: "Structure as: 'Meal Name • Codename • [timing details]'"
      placement: "Hero section bullet points"

quality_guidelines:
  information_density:
    - "Each bullet must convey workload category + specific actions"
    - "Balance brevity with usefulness"
    - "Avoid generic phrases (prefer specific timing)"
  
  user_mental_model:
    - "Codenames create workload expectations"
    - "Timing details enable scheduling"
    - "Together they answer: 'What kind of work?' + 'When do I do it?'"
  
  maintenance:
    - "Update codename assignments as new meal patterns emerge"
    - "Refine timing extraction based on user feedback"
    - "Keep format consistent across weeks"
