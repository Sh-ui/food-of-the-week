## Pork Tenderloin

#### Day:
Saturday

#### Protein:
Pork tenderloin

#### Ingredients:
Pork tenderloin, fresh rosemary, garlic, dijon mustard, maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, yukon gold potatoes, carrots, chicken stock, heavy cream, fresh thyme

#### Description:
A weekend-worthy pork tenderloin marinated in rosemary-mustard and roasted with root vegetables. The pork gets a quick sear then finishes in the oven, leaving you free to relax while it cooks. Served with a creamy pan sauce made from the drippings and roasted vegetables.

### Sous Chef - Prep

Trim any silver skin from the pork tenderloin and place in a large zip-top bag.

Mix 2 tbsp dijon mustard + 1 tbsp maple syrup + 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar + 2 minced garlic cloves + 1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary + salt/pepper. Pour over pork, seal bag, and massage to coat evenly. Let marinate on counter while you prep vegetables.

Cut yukon gold potatoes into 1-inch chunks and carrots into ½-inch rounds. Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a few sprigs of fresh thyme.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Preheat oven to 425°F.

Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. Sear pork tenderloin on all sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side.

Add the seasoned potatoes and carrots to the skillet around the pork. Transfer entire skillet to oven and roast for 20-25 minutes, until pork reaches 145°F internally and vegetables are tender and caramelized.

Remove pork to rest, covered with foil. Return vegetables to oven if they need more time.

For the sauce: Add ½ cup chicken stock to the hot skillet, scraping up all the browned bits. Stir in ¼ cup heavy cream and 1 tbsp dijon mustard. Simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Slice pork against the grain and serve with roasted vegetables and a generous drizzle of the creamy pan sauce.

## Maple Salmon & Brussels

#### Day:
Sunday

#### Protein:
Frozen salmon fillets

#### Ingredients:
Frozen salmon fillets, brussels sprouts, yellow onions, garlic, panko breadcrumbs, parmesan, meyer lemons, mixed greens, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup

#### Description:
Sheet-pan salmon and brussels sprouts with a maple-balsamic glaze. The salmon stays moist and flaky while the brussels get crispy and caramelized. Simple, healthy, and satisfying for a relaxed Sunday dinner with plenty of leftovers for quick weekday meals.

### Sous Chef - Prep

Thaw salmon fillets in cold water for 15-20 minutes, then pat dry and season with salt and pepper.

Trim brussels sprouts and cut in half. Slice 1 yellow onion into thin wedges. Toss brussels and onions with olive oil, salt, pepper, and 2 minced garlic cloves.

Mix 2 tbsp maple syrup + 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar + 1 tbsp dijon mustard for the glaze.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Preheat oven to 425°F.

Arrange salmon fillets and brussels sprouts mixture on a large sheet pan. Brush salmon with the maple-balsamic glaze.

Roast for 15-18 minutes until salmon flakes easily and brussels are crispy and caramelized at the edges.

Serve salmon atop the roasted brussels and onions. Squeeze fresh meyer lemon over everything. For extra crispiness, you can sprinkle with panko-parmesan mixture during the last 5 minutes of roasting.

Pair with a simple mixed greens salad dressed with olive oil, balsamic, and a squeeze of meyer lemon if desired.
