## ~~Water Burgers + Potato Salad~~

**Day** Saturday

**Protein** Frozen burger patties

**Ingredients** Swiss cheese, water roll buns, mushrooms, white onion (at home), new potatoes, whole grain mustard, green onion, cornichons, mixed greens

**Description** Classic water burgers with melted Swiss and sautéed mushrooms and onions, served alongside a rustic whole grain mustard potato salad and simply dressed greens.

**Already Prepped**

 - Burger patties are in the freezer.

**Potato Salad (can make ahead)**

Boil new potatoes whole until fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly, then cut into quarters or halves.

While still warm, toss with: whole grain mustard, olive oil, sliced green onion, capers, salt, and pepper. The warm potatoes will absorb the dressing. Serve at room temperature.

**Burgers**

Slice the white onion into rings. Slice the mushrooms.

In a large skillet, combine the onions and mushrooms with a generous amount of butter. Sauté briefly, then add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, a sprinkle of beef bouillon powder (or a bouillon cube), and a pinch of MSG. Pour in plenty of water—enough to create a shallow broth the patties can poach in.

Simmer until the mushrooms and onions are softened and the broth is rich and umami-packed, adding more water if needed. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Nestle the frozen burger patties directly into the bubbling onion-mushroom broth. Poach the patties, flipping once, until cooked through and juicy.

Lay slices of Swiss cheese over the patties while still in the pan, then stack the water roll buns (split-side down) over the cheese and patties to create a tall tower. Cover the skillet and let everything steam for a minute or two until the cheese is melted and the buns are pillowy and warm.

To serve, use a spatula to lift each cheesy patty along with a generous pile of the onions, mushrooms, and some of the reduced umami broth directly onto the bottom bun. Top with the bun and serve immediately.

**Plating**

Dress the mixed greens lightly with olive oil and lemon or a simple vinaigrette.

Assemble burgers: bun, patty with melted Swiss, pile of mushrooms and onions, top bun.

Serve with potato salad and dressed greens on the side.


## Gringo Taco Tostadas

**Day** Sunday

**Protein** Frozen gringo taco meat

**Ingredients** Tostadas, refried beans, shredded cheddar, sour cream (at home), cilantro, limes (at home), iceberg lettuce, plum tomatoes
