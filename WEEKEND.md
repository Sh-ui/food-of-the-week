**Ingredients** Sweet Italian sausage, ground beef, panko, fresh parsley, garlic, parmesan, egg, mozzarella, italian bagged salad, yukon gold potatoes, italian dressing, italian herbs, milk

**Description** Italian-American meatballs halfway between meatloaf and meatballs - the kind that get baked large and topped with gooey melted mozzarella. Comfort food that bakes hands-off while you relax. Served with classic wedge salad and garlicky Tuscan mash.

**Sous Chef - Prep**

Mix 1 lb sweet Italian sausage + 1 lb ground beef + 1 cup panko + chopped parsley + minced garlic + grated parmesan + egg + salt/pepper.

Form into 4-6 large balls (meatloaf-sized, not bite-sized) and place on a roasting sheet.

**Chef - Finishing & Plating**

Bake at 375°F for 25-30 minutes until mostly cooked through.

Top each meatball generously with shredded mozzarella and bake another 10 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.

For the mash: yukon gold potatoes until tender, drain and mash with roasted garlic + chopped parsley + italian herbs + milk/cream + salt/pepper + parmesan.

For the salad: mix italian bagged salad + italian dressing.
