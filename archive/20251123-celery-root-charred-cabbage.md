## Meal 1: Sous Vide Salmon with Celery Root Puree

#### Protein: Salmon

#### Ingredients: Celery root, heavy cream, butter, parsley, lemon

#### Description: Perfectly cooked sous vide salmon with torch-seared skin over silky celery root puree. Restaurant-quality precision cooking.

### Instructions
### Already Prepped
- Salmon fillets have been seasoned and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.

- Celery root has been vacuum sealed and pre-cooked sous vide. Stored in fridge ready to puree.

### Sous Chef - Prep
Drop the vacuum-sealed salmon into sous vide bath set to salmon temperature (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app, typically 122°F for tender texture).

Remove pre-cooked celery root from vacuum bag. Transfer to blender or food processor with heavy cream (start with ¼ cup), butter, salt, and pepper. Puree until silky smooth, adding more cream if needed.

Keep warm in covered pot or reheat gently before serving.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating
Remove salmon from sous vide bag, reserve any juices. Pat salmon completely dry, especially the skin side.

Using a kitchen torch, sear the skin side until deeply crispy and golden. For extra crisp, you can also sear flesh side briefly.

Alternatively, sear in screaming hot cast iron with oil, skin-side down for 2 minutes, then flip for 30 seconds.

Make quick sauce: Squeeze lemon into small pan with reserved salmon juices and a knob of butter.

Spoon celery root puree onto plates, top with salmon skin-side up. Drizzle with lemon butter and garnish with chopped parsley.

## Meal 2: Sous Vide Steak with Charred Cabbage and Roasted Potatoes

#### Protein: Flat iron steak

#### Ingredients: Red cabbage, russet potatoes, shallots, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar

#### Description: Deconstructed Midwestern broiler dinner reimagined - perfectly cooked sous vide steak finished with torch, charred cabbage wedges, and crispy potatoes.

### Instructions
### Already Prepped
- Flat iron steak has been seasoned and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.

### Sous Chef - Prep
Drop the vacuum-sealed steak into sous vide bath set to steak temperature (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app, typically 130-135°F for medium-rare).

Preheat oven to 425°F.

Cut potatoes into 1-inch chunks. Toss with oil, salt, and pepper on baking sheet. Roast for 30-35 minutes, flipping halfway.

Cut cabbage into thick wedges through the core (so they hold together). Slice shallots into thick rings.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating
Remove steak from sous vide bag, reserve ALL the juices. Pat steak completely dry.

Using a kitchen torch, sear all sides of the steak until a nice crust forms. Alternatively, sear in screaming hot cast iron 1 minute per side.

Heat large skillet over medium-high. Add cabbage wedges and shallot rings. Char on both sides until deeply golden, about 3-4 minutes per side.

Pour reserved steak bag juices into pan. Deglaze with splash of white wine or vinegar, scraping up browned bits. Add Dijon mustard and butter, creating a loose glaze.

Slice steak against the grain.

Plate with roasted potatoes as base, charred cabbage alongside, fanned steak on top. Drizzle with pan glaze and garnish with fresh parsley.

## Meal 3: Pork and Cabbage Egg Roll Bowls

#### Protein: Ground pork

#### Ingredients: Red cabbage, shallots, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar

#### Description: Deconstructed egg rolls without the wrappers - quick stir-fried pork and cabbage bowl with all the flavor, none of the frying.

### Instructions
### Already Prepped
- Ground pork is thawed.

### Sous Chef - Cooking
Start rice cooking if serving over rice (white or brown).

Shred red cabbage thinly. Mince shallots and ginger.

Brown ground pork in large skillet or wok, breaking it up as it cooks. Once browned, push to side of pan.

Add shallots and ginger to cleared space, cook 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add shredded cabbage and stir-fry for 4-5 minutes until wilted but still has crunch.

Season with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and a pinch of sugar. Toss everything together.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating
Taste and adjust seasoning. Add more soy for salt, more vinegar for tang.

Serve over rice in bowls. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallions if available.

Optional toppings: sour cream or Greek yogurt drizzle, chili crisp, extra sesame oil.

## Meal 4: Salmon Cakes with Caesar-ish Salad

#### Protein: Salmon (leftover from Meal 1)

#### Ingredients: Salmon, panko breadcrumbs, Dijon mustard, romaine lettuce, Parmesan, anchovy paste, lemon

#### Description: Crispy salmon patties with a lemony Caesar-inspired salad. Great use of leftover cooked salmon or can use canned.

### Instructions
### Already Prepped
- Cooked salmon from earlier in week (or can use canned salmon).

### Sous Chef - Prep
Flake cooked salmon (or drain canned salmon well) and mix with panko, 1 egg, Dijon mustard, minced shallot, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Form into 4-6 patties.

Chill patties for 10 minutes if time permits (helps them hold together).

Chop romaine into bite-sized pieces.

Make Caesar dressing: whisk together lemon juice, Dijon, anchovy paste (or finely minced capers), grated garlic, olive oil, and grated Parmesan. Adjust to taste.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating
Heat skillet with oil and butter over medium heat. Pan-fry salmon cakes 3-4 minutes per side until golden and crispy.

Toss romaine with Caesar dressing and more Parmesan.

Plate salad and top with warm salmon cakes. Serve with lemon wedges and crusty bread if desired.
