## ✓ Cod & Chips

##### Prep&Heat++
###### 5:30 bread + fry fish + prep slaw

#### Protein:
Cod

#### Ingredients:
Cod fillets, panko breadcrumbs, flour, eggs, shaved brussels sprouts, fire roasted corn, red cabbage, red onion, fresh parsley, white balsamic vinegar, jalapeño olive oil, yukon gold potatoes, mayo, lemon, fresh dill

#### Description:
Crispy panko-crusted cod shallow-fried to golden perfection, served with oven-roasted chips and a bright, crunchy winter slaw dressed with jalapeño olive oil and white balsamic. A deconstructed fish and chips elevated with fresh vegetables and bold flavors, finished with a simple lemon-herb white sauce.

### Already Prepped
- Cod fillets are thawed and ready.
- Potatoes have been cut into chips, boiled until nearly falling apart, and are sitting exposed to air on a sheet pan in the fridge (for maximum crispiness).
- Bagged shaved brussels sprouts are ready.
- Fire roasted corn is in a can, ready to use.

### Sous Chef - Cooking

Prep the slaw vegetables: Thinly slice half a red onion. Chop half a bunch of parsley. Shred a quarter of a red cabbage into thin strips. Combine in a large bowl with the shaved brussels sprouts and drained fire roasted corn. Leave undressed and store in fridge until Chef assembles.

Set up breading station with three shallow dishes: flour, beaten eggs, and panko breadcrumbs.

Pat cod fillets completely dry. Salt each side properly. Dredge each fillet in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg, letting excess drip off. Press firmly into panko to coat both sides thoroughly.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat with about ¼ inch of neutral oil. When oil shimmers, add breaded cod fillets. Shallow fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side, until fish flakes easily. Remove to paper towel-lined plate, transfer finished fillets to a wire rack set in a low oven to keep warm.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss the prepped potato chips generously with plenty of neutral oil and spread on a sheet pan in a single layer. Season with salt. Roast for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway, until deeply golden and crispy.

Make the white sauce: Whisk together mayo, fresh lemon juice, and finely chopped fresh dill. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and white pepper. Should be drizzlable.

Dress the slaw: Toss the prepared vegetables with white balsamic vinegar and jalapeño olive oil to taste. Season with salt and pepper. The slaw should be bright and punchy.

Plate each serving: Pile of oven-fried chips, crispy panko cod alongside, generous mound of dressed slaw. Drizzle the white sauce over everything.

## ✓ Chicken & Veg

##### Prep&Heat
###### 4:30 drop bags + make rice

#### Protein:
Chicken breast

#### Ingredients:
Chicken breast, green beans, carrots, garlic, butter, white wine, chicken stock, fresh herbs (thyme and/or rosemary), jasmine rice

#### Description:
A streamlined sous vide dinner where both protein and vegetables are already cooked and sealed—sous chef simply drops both bags in the bath to warm together. Chef finishes with a quick sear on the chicken and a simple pan sauce made from the bag juices. Served with fluffy rice and the perfectly cooked vegetables.

### Already Prepped
- Chicken breasts have been seasoned (salt, pepper, garlic, herbs) and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.
- Green beans and carrots have been cooked sous vide (butter, garlic, salt) and vacuum sealed. Stored in fridge.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At 4:30pm, drop both the chicken bag and the vegetable bag into the sous vide bath (Chef will set temperature remotely from the app to 153°F for reheating).

Start jasmine rice in the rice cooker.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Remove chicken and vegetables from bags. Reserve all bag juices (both chicken and veg). Pat chicken completely dry.

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. Sear chicken breasts on both sides until deeply golden, about 2-3 minutes per side.

Remove chicken to rest. In the same skillet, add reserved bag juices, a splash of white wine, and a splash of chicken stock. Reduce over medium-high heat, scraping up browned bits, until thickened into a glossy pan sauce. Swirl in a knob of butter. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Warm the sous vide vegetables briefly in the pan if needed, or plate directly.

Plate: Fluffy rice as a base, sliced chicken breast fanned on top, vegetables alongside. Spoon the pan sauce over the chicken and rice. Scatter fresh herbs if desired.

## ✓ Glazed Salmon

##### Prep&Heat+
###### 5:00 salmon & squash + prep salad

#### Protein:

#### Ingredients:
Salmon fillets, green onions, garlic, ginger paste, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, mirin, sake, butternut squash, mixed salad greens, shredded carrots, cucumber, Japanese sesame dressing, butter

#### Description:
Salmon fillets cooked sous vide, then glazed with a sweet and savory Japanese-inspired glaze of ketchup, mirin, soy. Plated with silky sous vide butternut squash cubes and a bright, crisp salad tossed with Japanese sesame dressing. Comforting, colorful, and bursting with umami.

### Already Prepped
- Salmon fillets are seasoned and vacuum sealed, ready for sous vide.
- Butternut squash is cut into cubes, cooked sous vide to the perfect texture with salt, and chilled.
  
### Sous Chef - Prep

At dinnertime, preheat the sous vide water bath to 120°F (or desired doneness for salmon).

Drop the salmon fillet bags and butternut squash bags into the water bath and let them warm together (about 20-30 minutes if coming from fridge).

Prep the salad: Combine mixed greens, shredded carrots, and thinly sliced cucumber in a bowl. Keep refrigerated and undressed until serving.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Remove the salmon and squash from their bags, patting the salmon fillets dry. Reserve any juices.

To a small saucepan, add worcestershire sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, mirin, and sake (roughly equal parts, about 2 tablespoons each, or to taste), plus ginger paste and minced garlic. Add reserved salmon juices if desired, and reduce, stirring, until glossy and thick, 2-3 minutes. Swirl in a bit of butter for richness.

Add the salmon to the pan and spoon glaze over fillets to coat.

Dress the salad with Japanese sesame dressing right before serving.

Plate: place the cubes of butternut squash, glazed salmon fillet with extra sauce spooned over, and a side of fresh salad. Garnish salmon with sliced green onions.

## ✓ Shrimp Scampi

##### Prep&Heat
###### cut vegetables + boil noodles

#### Protein:
Gulf shrimp (31-40 ct)

#### Ingredients:
Gulf shrimp, garlic, asparagus, celery (with leaves), red bell pepper, egg noodles, butter, white wine, lemon, fresh parsley, red pepper flakes

#### Description:
A fast stir-fried take on shrimp scampi that swaps spaghetti for egg noodles and adds quick-cooking vegetables for color and crunch. High heat, garlic butter, white wine, and lemon create that classic scampi flavor while asparagus, celery, and bell pepper keep it light and vegetal. The celery leaves add an herbaceous finish. Weeknight speed with restaurant flavors.

### Already Prepped
- Shrimp are thawed and deveined.

### Sous Chef - Prep

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the egg noodles.

Prep all vegetables: Cut asparagus into 2-inch pieces on the bias. Slice celery thinly on the bias (reserve the leaves, roughly chopped). Slice red bell pepper into thin strips. Mince plenty of garlic (at least 6 cloves).

Cook egg noodles according to package directions. Drain and toss with a little butter or oil to prevent sticking. Set aside.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

Heat a large wok or skillet over high heat with a drizzle of oil. Add asparagus, celery, and bell pepper. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until vegetables are crisp-tender and lightly charred. Remove to a plate.

Add a bit more oil to the same pan, still over high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer, season with salt and pepper. Let them sear undisturbed for about 1 minute, then flip and cook another minute until just pink and cooked through. Remove shrimp to the plate with vegetables.

Reduce heat to medium. Add butter and minced garlic to the pan. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add white wine and a squeeze of lemon juice. Let it bubble and reduce slightly, scraping up any browned bits.

Return shrimp and vegetables to the pan along with the cooked egg noodles. Toss everything together in the garlic butter sauce. Add red pepper flakes to taste. Finish with chopped fresh parsley and the reserved celery leaves.

Plate in bowls, making sure everyone gets plenty of that garlic butter sauce. Serve with extra lemon wedges on the side.
