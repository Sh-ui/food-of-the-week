## Lazy Meatballs

###### chill potatoes + 5:00 meatballs + prep salad

#### Protein:
Sweet Italian sausage + ground beef

#### Ingredients:
Sweet Italian sausage, ground beef, panko, fresh parsley, garlic, parmesan, egg, mozzarella, italian bagged salad, shredded carrots, shallot, olives, yukon gold potatoes, italian dressing, italian herbs, heavy cream

#### Description:
Italian-American meatballs halfway between meatloaf and meatballs - the kind that get baked large and topped with gooey melted mozzarella. Served with Italian salad and garlicky Tuscan mash.

### Already Prepped
- Meatballs are formed and chilling in the fridge.
- Potatoes are already cooking in the sous vide bath.

### Sous Chef - Prep

At around **11:00** you should recieve a notification that it is time to remove the potatoes form the sous vide, take the bag out and put it in the fridge to chill until dinner time.

Make the Italian salad by combining the italian bag mix with olives, shredded carrots, and one finely diced shallot. Leave undressed. Store in fridge until serving.

At 5:00pm on the lower rack, put meatballs in oven at 400°F. Insert predictive thermometer at an angle into center meatball, **set it's temp to 160°F**.

When meatballs hit temp, pull them out of the oven and let them rest on the stovetop, but **do not** remove the probe.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating

For the mash: use the already-cooked potatoes, pressed garlic, chopped parsley, chopped basil, dried oregano, heavy cream, and parmesan. Season with salt and white pepper.

Make the dressing by combining the dressing packet according to its instructions, using olive oil, vinegar, and water.

Shred some mozzarella off a block to cover the meatballs. Put them back under the broiler to warm them back up and finish the cheese.

Serve meatballs with melted cheese on top, garlicky Tuscan mash on the side, and Italian salad.

## Gnocchi Puttanesca

#### Description:
A fast, one-pan gnocchi puttanesca built around anchovies and capers for depth, cherry tomatoes for sweetness, and mushrooms for bulk. Finished with wilted spinach, Meyer lemon zest and parsley for lift. Served with a ready-made Caesar to add cold crunch and structure to the meal.

### Already Prepped
- Anchovies and gnocchi are ready to heat.
- Spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms are ready to cook.
- Caesar salad kit is ready to assemble.

### Sous Chef - Prep

Use a vegetable peeler to peel the outer layer of zesty skin from 1 Meyer lemon, chop it throuhroughly together with a half bunch of parsley and 3-4 garlic cloves. _This is the **gremolata**._ Store the gremolata in the fridge for later use by Chef.

Open the Caesar salad kit dumped into a bowl, but keep refrigerated and undressed until serving.

### Chef - Cooking & Plating

Heat a wide skillet over medium-high heat with just enough olive oil to coat the bottom and crisp ones side of the gnocchi.

Add gnocchi directly to the pan in a single layer. Let sit undisturbed until deeply golden on that first side, then toss and continue until lightly crisped overall. Take gnocchi out of the pan and set aside.

Add anchovy fillets to the oil and mash/stir until fully dissolved. Add a little bit of the gremolata to this oil and bloom briefly.

Add mushrooms and cook until they release moisture and begin to brown.

Add cherry tomatoes and let them blister and _just start_ to collapse, then stir in capers.

Fold gnocchi back into the pan along with the spinach, and fold gently until just wilted and brought together.

Finish with black pepper, gremolata, and parmesan when plating.

At the table to taste: halved meyer lemons to squeeze over, and the EVOO bottle to drizzle if desired.
