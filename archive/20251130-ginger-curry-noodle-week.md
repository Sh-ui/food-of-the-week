Start rice cooking if serving with rice (optional - also great on its own).

Pour in coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Add the carrot coins and let them cook for 5-7 minutes until starting to soften.

Add the chopped napa cabbage and cook for another 3-4 minutes until wilted but still has some crunch. Season with fish sauce and a squeeze of lime.

### Chef - Finishing & Plating
Taste and adjust seasoning - more fish sauce for salt, more lime for brightness, more curry paste for heat.

Serve in bowls with fresh cilantro and lime wedges. Can be served over rice or on its own as a brothy curry bowl.
